 subject re how large are commercial keys from pgut one cs aukuni ac nz peter gutmann organization computer science dept university of auckland lines one seven in butzerd maumee eng ohio state edu dane c butzer writes what are the typical sizes for keys for commercial secret key algorithms i know des is five six bits tripple des is one one two bits and idea is one two eight bits is there anything made in the us that has one two eight bit keys anything anywhere that has larger keys i ve heard that rc two can be scaled to arbitrarily large keys but is this actually implemented anywhere my mdc cipher which uses any one way hash function as a cfb mode stream cipher the current implementation uses md five uses a key of up to two zero four eight bits that is you can use a one bit key if you want and copy it over the entire two zero four eight bit range or you can use the entire two zero four eight bits runtime is independant of key size the system runs slightly slower than md five itself i presume rc two and rc four use a similar system or possibly they just hash an arbitrary length key down to n bits maybe one two eight using something like md five peter
