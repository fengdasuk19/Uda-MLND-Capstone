 from butzerd maumee eng ohio state edu dane c butzer subject how large are commercial keys organization the ohio state university dept of electrical engineering lines one three what are the typical sizes for keys for commercial secret key algorithms i know des is five six bits tripple des is one one two bits and idea is one two eight bits is there anything made in the us that has one two eight bit keys anything anywhere that has larger keys i ve heard that rc two can be scaled to arbitrarily large keys but is this actually implemented anywhere finally can anyone even concieve of a time place where one two eight bit keys aren t sufficient i certainly can t even at a trillion keys a second it would take about one zero billion years to search just one billionth of that keys space thanks dane
