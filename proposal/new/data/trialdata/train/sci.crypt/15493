summary c functions to do arbitrary precision arith x newsreader tin version one one pl eight this is the file bignums txt from ripem msu edu last updated april one nine nine three in response to email requests i have assembled this list of large integer arithmetic packages of which i have heard most of these are c function libraries available in source form for your convenience i have placed copies of some of these on ripem msu edu three five eight one one seven eight they are available for anonymous ftp in the directory pub bignum however what i have may not be the most current version in all cases here they are in no particular order mp multiple precision package that comes with some unixes multiple precision package accessed via lmp flag on your compiler provides gcd exponentiation sqrt comes with sunos next mach bbn mach one zero zero zero and probably a few others see man mp object code only of course pari henri cohen et al universite bordeaux i paris france multiple precision desk calculator and library routines contains optimized assembly code for motorola six eight zero two zero semi optimized code for sparc and apparently rather slow generic c version does both integers and reals does vectors and matrices as well as scalars contains a number of advanced functions some of which i ve never heard of weber s function has a factorization function primality test i have tried to add enough comments to get by this is the only of these packages that i have actually used it works well and is very portable i haven t done any benchmarks against the others but the code looks clever also includes and rand for rational numbers filename briggs arith pas institute fur experimentelle mathematik dr gerhard schneider fast c multiple precision subroutine library i don t know anything about it sl two five ely cl cam ac uk says to contact mat four two zero de zero hrz one a bitnet for more info postal address institute fur experimentelle mathematik ellernstr two nine d four three zero zero essen one two germany longint markus mueller mueller komsys tik ethz ch multi precision arithmetic written in modula two with the most time critical parts written in assembler includes basic arithmetics as well as arithmetics modulo a number an additional module provides a collection of procedures for primality testing gcd multiplicative inverse and more the package is part of a privacy enhanced mail pem package which includes a pem mailer rsa key generator and certificate generation tools source is in modula two c and assembler for sun three longint has also been ported to ms dos under logitech modula two and turbo assembler availability free for university use research and education otherwise a source license is required to obtain write or email to markus mueller bertastrasse seven ch eight nine five three dietikon switzerland email mueller komsys tik ethz ch bignum one two henrik johansson nexus comm se bignum package written in portable c will in the future conform to the common lisp functions that handles integers currently includes exponentiation exptmod comparison random numbers and gcd filename bignum one two gnu multiple precision gnu free software foundation multiple precision package i haven t looked at it yet this is current as of april one nine nine two but there may be a more recent version by the time you read this this package is very widely available on ftp sites filename gmp one two tar z elliptic curve primality proving francois morian france large package to prove the primality of any prime includes inria s bignum package obtained from ftp inria fr one two eight nine three one two six filename ecpp v three four one tar z pgp pretty good privacy philip zimmermann prz sage cgd ucar edu intel based crypto package that includes bignum routines in c said to be quite fast for intel processors unix and mac versions also available the crypto package violates rsa patents but the bignum routines can be used without fear of legal repercussions bell s arbitrary precision calculator david i bell australia dbell pdact pd necisa oz au arbitrary precision calculator with good online help c like language many builtin functions support for integers rational numbers they work like floating point complex numbers matrices strings lists files objects includes gcd primality testing even trig functions recommended large package though obtained from comp sources unix filename calc one two four seven tar z built in support in other languages various multiple precision arithmetic is available in a number of programming languages such as lisp and abc cf mcsun eu net perl by larry wall available from devvax jpl nasa gov includes source in perl for such a package but it s probably not suitable for serious use for some of these source code may be available this list is long enough so i m not going to pursue it aggressively thanks to ed vielmetti and several others who contributed to this list mark riordan mrr ripem msu edu
