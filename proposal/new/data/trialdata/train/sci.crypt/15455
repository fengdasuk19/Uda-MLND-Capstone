 from denning guvax acc georgetown edu subject the clipper chip a technical summary distribution world organization georgetown university lines one three nine the following document summarizes the clipper chip how it is used how programming of the chip is coupled to key generation and the escrow process and how law enforcement decrypts communications since there has been some speculation on this news group about my own involvement in this project i d like to add that i was not in any way involved i found out about it when the fbi briefed me on thursday evening april one five since then i have spent considerable time talking with the nsa and fbi to learn more about this and i attended the nist briefing at the department of commerce on april one six the document below is the result of that effort dorothy denning the clipper chip a technical summary dorothy denning april one nine one nine nine three introduction on april one six the president announced a new initiative that will bring together the federal government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement at the heart of the plan is a new tamper proof encryption chip called the clipper chip together with a split key approach to escrowing keys two escrow agencies are used and the key parts from both are needed to reconstruct a key chip structure the clipper chip contains a classified six four bit block encryption algorithm called skipjack the algorithm uses eight zero bit keys compared with five six for the des and has three two rounds of scrambling compared with one six for the des it supports all four des modes of operation throughput is one six mbits a second each chip includes the following components the skipjack encryption algorithm f an eight zero bit family key that is common to all chips n a three zero bit serial number u an eight zero bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip encrypting with the chip to see how the chip is used imagine that it is embedded in the at k the encrypted message stream and eek u n f a law enforcement block the law enforcement block thus contains the session key k encrypted under the unit key u concatenated with the serial number n all encrypted under the family key f chip programming and escrow all clipper chips are programmed inside a scif secure computer information facility which is essentially a vault the scif contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips about three zero zero chips are programmed during a single session the scif is located at mikotronx at the beginning of a session a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault agent one enters an eight zero bit value s one into the laptop and agent two enters an eight zero bit value s two these values serve as seeds to generate keys for a sequence of serial numbers to generate the unit key for a serial number n the three zero bit value n is first padded with a fixed three four bit block to produce a six four bit block n one s one and s two are then used as keys to triple encrypt n one producing a six four bit block r one r one eden one s one s two s one similarly n is padded with two other three four bit blocks to produce n two and n three and two additional six four bit blocks r two and r three are computed r two eden two s one s two s one r three eden three s one s two s one r one r two and r three are then concatenated together giving one nine two bits the first eight zero bits are assigned to u one and the second eight zero bits to u two the rest are discarded the unit key u is the xor of u one and u two u one and u two are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies as a sequence of values for u one u two and u are generated they are written onto three separate floppy disks the first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part u one the second disk is similar but contains the u two values the third disk contains the unit keys u agent one takes the first disk and agent two takes the second disk the third disk is used to program the chips after the chips are programmed all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave the laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind the protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two the first two would provide the seeds s one and s two and the second two the escrow agents would take the disks back to the escrow agencies the escrow agencies have as yet to be determined but they will not be the nsa cia fbi or any other law enforcement agency one or both may be independent from the government law enforcement use when law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with clipper they will first decrypt the law enforcement block with the family key f this gives them ek u n they will then take a warrant identifying the chip serial number n to each of the key escrow agents and get back u one and u two u one and u two are xored together to produce the unit key u and ek u is decrypted to get the session key k finally the message stream is decrypted all this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder operated by the fbi acknowledgment and distribution notice all information is based on information provided by nsa nist and the fbi permission to distribute this document is granted
