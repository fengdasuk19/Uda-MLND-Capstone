general news media in the past a person who uses computers and networks to malicious ends such as breaking into systems has been referred to as a hacker but most internet users prefer the term cracker for this instead a hacker is perceived as a benign but intensely ambitious curious and driven computer user who explores obscure areas of a system for example something of a proud electronic pioneer and patriot this is the sense intended in this document see also the hacker s dictionary and the faq alt security faq what is a cypherpunk from the charter of the cypherpunk mailing list cypherpunks assume privacy is a good thing and wish there were more of it cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy must create it for themselves and not expect governments corporations or other large faceless organizations to grant them privacy out of beneficence cypherpunks know that people have been creating their own privacy for centuries with whispers envelopes closed doors and couriers cypherpunks do not seek to prevent other people from speaking about their experiences or their opinions see information on the cypherpunk mailing list below see also the cryptoanarchist manifesto and the cryptography glossary in soda berkeley edu pub cypherpunks what is steganography and anonymous pools closely associated with encryption is steganography or the techniques for not only pursuing private encrypted communication but concealing the very existence of the communication itself many new possibilities in this area are introduced with the proliferation of computer technology for example it is possible to encode messages in the least significant bits of images typically the most noisy in addition when such an item is posted in a public place such as a newsgroup virtually untraceable communication can take place between sender and receiver for steganographic communications in the electronic realm one another possibility is setting up a mailing list where individual messages get broadcast to the entire list and individual users decode particular messages with their unique key an anonymous pool has been set up by miron cuperman miron extropia wimsey com for experiments send email to with one of the following commands in the subject line subscribe unsubscribe help what is security through obscurity security through obscurity refers to the attempt to gain protection from system weaknesses by hiding sensitive information or programs relating to them for example a company may not make public information on its software s encryption techniques to evade attacks based on knowledge of it another example would be concealing data on the existence of security holes or bugs in operating systems or some reliance may be made on the fact that some standard or mechanism with potential problems is serious because they are not widely known or not widely used this argument is occasionally applied to mechanisms for email and usenet posting forgery security through obscurity is regarded as a very feeble technique at best and inappropriate and ineffective at worst also called the head in the sand approach see the faq for alt security some remarks of john perry barlow cofounder of the electronic frontier foundation directed to nsa agents at the first international symposium on national security national competitiveness held in mclean virginia dec one one nine nine two digitized information is very hard to stamp classified or keep contained this stuff is incredibly leaky and volatile it s almost a life form in its ability to self propagate if something hits the net and it s something which people on there find interesting it will spread like a virus of the mind i believe you must simply accept the idea that we are moving into an environment where any information which is at all interesting to people is going to get out and there will be very little that you can do about it this is not a bad thing in my view but you may differ what are identity daemons rfc nine three one describes a protocol standard that allows unix programs to query a remote user s login name after connection to a local communication socket a connection of this type is established during ftp and telnet sessions for example the standard is not widely supported perhaps one zero of internet sites currently implement it but the number is increasing the mechanism is detrimental to anonymity regular users cannot disable it but system adminstrators can circumvent it this standard may represent a trend toward greater authentication mechanisms what new standards are needed to guard electronic privacy remailing posting stable secure protected officially sanctioned and permitted publicly and privately operated anonymous servers and hubs official standards for encryption and anonymity in mail and usenet postings truly anonymous protocols with source and destination information obscured or absent and hidden routing mechanisms chaining encrypted

mission statement a new world is arising in the vast web of digital electronic media which connect us computer based communication media like electronic mail and computer conferencing are becoming the basis of new forms of community these communities without a single fixed geographical location comprise the first settlements on an electronic frontier while well established legal principles and cultural norms give structure and coherence to uses of conventional media like newspapers books and telephones the new digital media do not so easily fit into existing frameworks conflicts come about as the law struggles to define its application in a context where fundamental notions of speech property and place take profoundly new forms people sense both the promise and the threat inherent in new computer and communications technologies even as they struggle to master or simply cope with them in the workplace and the home the electronic frontier foundation has been established to help civilize the electronic frontier to make it truly useful and beneficial not just to a technical elite but to everyone and to do this in a way which is in keeping with our society s highest traditions

massive show trials never materialized although isolated instances of prosecution were pursued the movement reached a crescendo in texas with the highly publicized case of illegal search and seizure involving the steve jackson games company of austin texas on march one one nine nine zero from the column gurps labour lost by bruce sterling in fantasy and science fiction magazine in an early morning raid with an unlawful and unconstitutional warrant agents of the secret service conducted a search of the sjg office when they left they took a manuscript being prepared for publication

sparks grew visibly angry when it was established that the austin science fiction magazine and game book publisher was never suspected of a crime and that agents did not do even marginal research to establish a criminal connection between the firm and the suspected illegal activities of an employee or to determine that the company was a publisher indeed agents testified that they were not even trained in the privacy protection act at the special secret service school on computer crime how long would it have taken you mr foley to find out what steve jackson games did what it was asked sparks

privacy experts software manufacturers and telephone companies the fbi proposed legislation to amend the communications act of one nine three four to make it easier for the bureau to perform electronic wiretapping the proposed legislation entitled digital telephony would have required communications service providers and hardware manufacturers to make their systems tappable by providing back doors through which law enforcement officers could intercept communications furthermore this capability would have been provided undetectably while the communications was in progress exclusive of any communications between other parties regardless of the mobility of the target of the fbi s investigation and without degradation of service under the proposal the department of justice doj can keep communications products off the market if it determines that these products do not meet the doj s own guidelines this could result in increased costs and reduced competitiveness for service providers and equipment manufacturers since they will be unlikely to add any features that may result in a doj rejection of their entire product the fbi proposal suggests that the cost of this wiretapping service to the bureau would have to be borne by the service provider itself the electronic frontier foundation organized a broad coalition of public interest and industry groups from

language according to bruce sterling the internet s anarchy may seem strange or even unnatural but it makes a certain deep and basic sense it s rather like the anarchy of the english language nobody rents english and nobody owns english as an english speaking person it s up to you to learn how to speak english properly and make whatever use you please of it though the government provides certain subsidies to help you learn to read and write a bit otherwise everybody just sort of pitches in and somehow the thing evolves on its own and somehow turns out workable and interesting fascinating even though a lot of people earn their living from using and exploiting and teaching english english as an institution is public property a public good much the same goes for the internet would english be improved if the the english language inc had a board of directors and a chief executive officer or a president and a congress there d probably be a lot fewer new words in english and a lot fewer new
