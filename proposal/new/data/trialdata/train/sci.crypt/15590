uni sb de mrr scss three cl msu edu mark riordan writes not very comprehensive list deleted there is a very comprehensive list in sci math symbolic which detailed descriptions of many packages especially you mark should update your list here it is available systems this is the list of currently developed and distributed software for symbolic math applications no informations is supplied on systems no longer being supported like saint formac alpak altran mathlab sin sac camal scratchpad mumath sheep trigman analitik smp or ccalc for more detailed info on any of the systems below look into the directory pub symbolic math in the anonymous ftp of math berkeley edu no particular recommendation is made for any of these if you want prices contact the company programs are listed by aprox the reverse order of the number of machines they run on in each class general purpose systems first if you have any information to add to this list we know we are missing mupad basically gnu copyleft
