 from hanson kronos arc nasa gov robin hanson subject estimating wiretap costs benefits nntp posting host jabberwock arc nasa gov organization nasa arc information sciences division lines three eight i m attempting to write a serious policy paper examining whether the proposed wiretap or clipper chip is a cost effective tool for police investigation that is ignoring concerns about government intrusions into individual privacy is the value of easy wiretaps to investigators greater than the cost to the communications industry and their customers to support this wiretap technology a rough estimate suggests that wiretaps are worth about five million dollars per year to u s law enforcement agencies in one nine nine zero eight seven two u s wiretaps led to two zero five seven arrests while total police expenditures of two eight billion led to one one two five million arrests ref us statistical abstracts i m working on estimating this wiretap benefit more accurately but i d like to ask hardware experts out there to help me with estimating the costs of the new proposed wiretap technology please send me quotable citeable estimates for how many chips which would need to be made per year to keep all phones with wiretap chips how much would it cost to make each chip how much did it cost to develop this technology in the first place how much more would supporting hardware people etc cost per chip what percentage cheaper would encryption chips and support have been if private enterprise could compete to meet customer encryption needs what percentage of phone traffic would be taken up by the proposed law enforcement blocks what is the total cost of handling all phone traffic per year put another way the question i m asking is what if each police agency that wanted a particular wiretap had to pay for it being charged their share of the full social cost of forcing communication to be wiretap compatible would they choose to buy such wiretaps or would they find it more cost effective to instead investigate crimes in other ways robin hanson hanson ptolemy arc nasa gov four one five six zero four three three six one ms two six nine two nasa ames research center moffett field ca nine four zero three five five one zero six five one seven four eight three four seven one six four male terrace fremont ca nine four five three nine seven nine two one
