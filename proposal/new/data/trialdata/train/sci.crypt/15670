 from denning guvax acc georgetown edu subject revised technical summary of clipper chip distribution world organization georgetown university lines one six seven here is a revised version of my summary which corrects some errors and provides some additional information and explanation the clipper chip a technical summary dorothy denning revised april two one one nine nine three introduction on april one six the president announced a new initiative that will bring together the federal government and industry in a voluntary program to provide secure communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law enforcement at the heart of the plan is a new tamper proof encryption chip called the clipper chip together with a split key approach to escrowing keys two escrow agencies are used and the key parts from both are needed to reconstruct a key chip contents the clipper chip contains a classified single key six four bit block encryption algorithm called skipjack the algorithm uses eight zero bit keys compared with five six for the des and has three two rounds of scrambling compared with one six for the des it supports all four des modes of operation the algorithm takes three two clock ticks and in electronic codebook ecb mode runs at one two mbits per second each chip includes the following components the skipjack encryption algorithm f an eight zero bit family key that is common to all chips n a three zero bit serial number this length is subject to change u an eight zero bit secret key that unlocks all messages encrypted with the chip the chips are programmed by mykotronx inc which calls them the myk seven eight the silicon is supplied by vlsi technology inc they are implemented in one micron technology and will initially sell for about three zero each in quantities of one zero zero zero zero or more the price should drop as the technology is shrunk to eight micron encrypting with the chip to see how the chip is used imagine that it is embedded in the at k the encrypted message stream and eek u n f a law enforcement field which are transmitted over the telephone line the law enforcement field thus contains the session key k encrypted under the unit key u concatenated with the serial number n all encrypted under the family key f the law enforcement field is decrypted by law enforcement after an authorized wiretap has been installed the ciphertext em k is decrypted by the receiver s device using the session key dem k k m chip programming and escrow all clipper chips are programmed inside a scif secure compartmented information facility which is essentially a vault the scif contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips about three zero zero chips are programmed during a single session the scif is located at mykotronx at the beginning of a session a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault agent one enters a secret random eight zero bit value s one into the laptop and agent two enters a secret random eight zero bit value s two these random values serve as seeds to generate unit keys for a sequence of serial numbers thus the unit keys are a function of one six zero secret random bits where each agent knows only eight zero to generate the unit key for a serial number n the three zero bit value n is first padded with a fixed three four bit block to produce a six four bit block n one s one and s two are then used as keys to triple encrypt n one producing a six four bit block r one r one eden one s one s two s one similarly n is padded with two other three four bit blocks to produce n two and n three and two additional six four bit blocks r two and r three are computed r two eden two s one s two s one r three eden three s one s two s one r one r two and r three are then concatenated together giving one nine two bits the first eight zero bits are assigned to u one and the second eight zero bits to u two the rest are discarded the unit key u is the xor of u one and u two u one and u two are the key parts that are separately escrowed with the two escrow agencies as a sequence of values for u one u two and u are generated they are written onto three separate floppy disks the first disk contains a file for each serial number that contains the corresponding key part u one the second disk is similar but contains the u two values the third disk contains the unit keys u agent one takes the first disk and agent two takes the second disk thus each agent walks away knowing an eight zero bit seed and the eight zero bit key parts however the agent does not know the other eight zero bits used to generate the keys or the other eight zero bit key parts the third disk is used to program the chips after the chips are programmed all information is discarded from the vault and the agents leave the laptop may be destroyed for additional assurance that no information is left behind the protocol may be changed slightly so that four people are in the room instead of two the first two would provide the seeds s one and s two and the second two the escrow agents would take the disks back to the escrow agencies the escrow agencies have as yet to be determined but they will not be the nsa cia fbi or any other law enforcement agency one or both may be independent from the government law enforcement use when law enforcement has been authorized to tap an encrypted line they will first take the warrant to the service provider in order to get access to the communications line let us assume that the tap is in place and that they have determined that the line is encrypted with the clipper chip the law enforcement field is first decrypted with the family key f giving ek u n documentation certifying that a tap has been authorized for the party associated with serial number n is then sent e g via secure fax to each of the key escrow agents who return e g also via secure fax u one and u two u one and u two are xored together to produce the unit key u and ek u is decrypted to get the session key k finally the message stream is decrypted all this will be accomplished through a special black box decoder capstone the next generation a successor to the clipper chip called capstone by the government and myk eight zero by mykotronx has already been developed it will include the skipjack algorithm the digital signature standard dss the secure hash algorithm sha a method of key exchange a fast exponentiator and a randomizer a prototoype will be available for testing on april two two and the chips are expected to be ready for delivery in june or july acknowledgment and distribution notice this article is based on information provided by nsa nist fbi and mykotronx permission to distribute this document is granted
