 from c four four five five eight five mizzou one missouri edu john kelsey subject re how large are commercial keys nntp posting host mizzou one missouri edu organization university of missouri lines two zero in article butzerd maumee eng ohio state edu dane c butzer writes finally can anyone even concieve of a time place where one two eight bit keys aren t sufficient i certainly can t even at a trillion keys a second it would take about one zero billion years to search just one billionth of that keys space it depends on the attack adding a bit to the key doubles the amount of work to be done in a straight brute force attack where you try every single possible key until one works processing and storage requirements for this kind of attack on a one two eight bit key seem like they ought to make it effectively impossible however there may be other attacks whose difficulty is for example proportional to say two sqrt n or some such also a long key does you little good if there is a way to incrementally guess a little of the key at a time thanks dane john
