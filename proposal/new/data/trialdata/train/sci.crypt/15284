 from smb research att com steven bellovin subject clipper some new thoughts organization at the keys the repository agents would deliver wouldn t last for very long i suspect that the cryptographic algorithm itself is secure apart from the obvious why push a weak algorithm when you ve already got the back door i think that the government is still genuinely concerned about foreign espionage especially aimed at commercial targets this scheme lets the spooks have their cake and eat it too i ve heard rumors over the years that some factions within nsa were unhappy with des because it was too good not that they couldn t crack it but it was much too expensive to do so as easily as they d want they re keeping the details secret so that others don t build their own implementations without the back door the cryptographic protocol though is another matter i see no valid reasons for keeping it secret and as i hope i ve shown above there are a lot of ways to do things that aren t quite as bad
