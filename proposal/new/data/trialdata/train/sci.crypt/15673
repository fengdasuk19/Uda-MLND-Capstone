 from carl lvsun com carl shapiro subject re estimating wiretap costs benefits summary benefits probably greater than thought organization las vegas sun lines one six in article hanson kronos arc nasa gov robin hanson writes a rough estimate suggests that wiretaps are worth about five million dollars per year to u s law enforcement agencies in one nine nine zero eight seven two u s wiretaps led to two zero five seven arrests while total police expenditures of two eight billion led to one one two five million arrests ref us statistical abstracts i m working on estimating this wiretap benefit more accurately but you seem to be assuming that all arrests are of equal value and that the use of wiretaps is spread uniformly among them given this comparatively tiny number of wiretaps and the associated difficulty and cost involved judges technicians etc i expect that law enforcement reserves the use of wiretaps for the most valuable cases since the value of an arrest can vary over an enormous range eg jaywalking mass murder i think your five million estimate may be too low by a couple of orders of magnitude
