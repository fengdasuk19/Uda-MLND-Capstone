 from maridai comm mot com marida ignacio subject re what was the immaculate conception organization trunking fixed lines one one one note i am cross posting actually emailing this to bit listserv catholic while main posting goes to soc religion christian quotations omitted this is in response to a question about the immaculate conception i explained it but left justification up to our catholic readers clh there is no direct reference in the holy scripture except for the mention of mary s blessedness full of grace in the annunciation by angel gabriel in luke one two six two eight and in the six th month the angel gabriel was sent from god unto a city of galilee named nazareth to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was joseph of the house of david and the virgin s name was mary and the angel came unto her and said hail thou that art highly favoured the lord is with thee blessed art thou among women now now hold that line of thought the lord is with mary she is god s eden in whom there is no tree of knowledge and no serpent that harms her perfect beauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in christ her purity in that of the father at the time of the council of ephesus she was hailed as innocent without blemish immaculate inviolate spotless holy in soul and body who was blessed as a lily from among thorns unlearned in the evil ways of eve at the end of the thirteenth century an irish franciscan john duns scotus one two six six one three zero eight god maintained that it was a greater thing for him to preserve his the son mother from all sin than to use his power to clease her from it later now let s go to the discussion of baptism and original sin from pocket catholic cathechism by john a hardon baptism concupiscence remains after baptism concupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized but since it is left to provide trial it has no power to injure those who do not consent and who by the grace of christ jesus manfully resist canon five original gifts of adam and eve before their fall in the light of the foregoing we see that our first parents were originally gifted three times over they had the natural gifts of human beings especially the power to think and to choose freely the had the preternatural gifts of bodily immortality and of integrity or the internal power to control desires they had the supernatural gifts of sanctifying grace the virtues of faith hope and charity and the corresponding title to enter heaven by their disobedience they lost the supernatural and preternatural gifts entirely and were weakened without losing their natural capacity to reason and to choose freely baptism restores the supernatural life lost by adam s sin it does not restore the preternatural gifts but gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our bodies on the last day going back to immaculate conception i am not sure if this interpretation is in any other books but it may be another contribution to the puzzle given the miracle of st anne bearing a child at a non childbearing age and christ was not yet born and there was no baptism yet on mary s birth but still the angel gabriel s greetings was hail mary full of grace the lord is with you blessed art thou amongst women even mary was confused about this greeting mary could very well have possessed all of the treefold original gifts above given to our first parents adam and eve before their sin hail mary example of praise given by the angel gabriel full of grace natural preternatural supernatural the lord is with you at those times god would definitely want to be with those he has made blessed blessed art thou amongst women that says it all at the conception god made mary full of grace and blessed as the tabernacle for the coming body of christ and so immaculate conception of mary is true and mary still has maintained her immaculate heart marida p s i do hope that others will continue more light and facts on this matter thanks
