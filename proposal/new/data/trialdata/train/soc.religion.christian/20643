 from dsegard nyx cs du edu daniel segard subject re easter what s in a name was re new testament double stan organization nyx public access unix at u of denver math cs dept lines one five mcovingt aisun three ai uga edu michael covington writes and the same goes for other cultural practices the festival of easter may possibly have some historical association with some pagan festival but today there are as far as i know no christians who intend to honor any kind of pagan goddess by celebrating easter that argument would be more compelling if it were not for the ishtar eggs and ishtar bunnies why mix pagan fertility symbols from the worship of the pagan goddess of fertility with biblical belief what would really be lost if all of you were to just drop the word easter and replace all such occurances with resurrection sunday would you not show up for services if they were called resurrection sunday services rather than easter services
