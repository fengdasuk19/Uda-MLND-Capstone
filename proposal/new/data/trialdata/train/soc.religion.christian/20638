 from shd two zero zero one andy bgsu edu sherlette dixon subject christianity he apologized for reading my mail said that he did not want to appear to be a snoop he said that he would be willing to talk to me about his views didn t mind doing so especially with a friend so we did i neither changed his mind nor did he change mine as that was not the point now he knows where i m coming from now i know where he s coming from and all that i can do is pray for him as i ve always done i believe the reason that he i click instead of bash heads is because i see christianity as a tool for revolution not a tool for maintaining the status quo to be quite blunt i have more of a reason to reject god than he does just by the fact that i am an african american female christianity religion have been used as tools to separate my people from the true knowledge of our history the wealth of our contributions to the world society the kitchen of heaven was all we had to look forward to during the slave days this mentality second class status still exists today i too have rejected an aspect of christianity that of the estabished church too much hypocricy exists behind the walls of god s house beginning with the images of a white jesus to that of the members praise god on sunday raise hell beginning monday god willing i will find a church home where i can feel comfortable at home but i don t see it happening anytime soon sherlette
