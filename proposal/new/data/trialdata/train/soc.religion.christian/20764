 from jono mac ak two four rtsg mot com jon ogden subject re help organization motorola lpa development lines eight seven i m a commited christian that is battling with a problem i know that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds yet hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless saying you fools do you still think that just believing is enough stuff deleted now i am of the opinion that you a saved through faith alone not what you do as taught in romans but how can i square up in my mind the teachings of james in conjunction with the lukewarm christian being spat out can anyone help me this really bothers me will there has been a lot of discussion going on about this over in s r c b s i will make the case here though and try to help you out eight for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god nine not of works lest any man should boast ephesians two eight nine yes it is by god s grace and our faith that we are saved we are not saved by what we do however one five if ye love me keep my commandments john one four one five keeping christ s commandments is a work per se and a demonstration of our love for him also six he spake also this parable a certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard and he came and sought fruit thereon and found none seven then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard behold these three years i come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none cut it down why cumbereth it the ground eight and he answering said unto him lord let it alone this year also till i shall dig about it and dung it nine and if it bear fruit well and if not then after that thou shalt cut it down luke one three six nine again one six ye have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever ye shall ask of the father in my name he may give it you john one five one six it is clear from these verses that we are called to bring forth fruit what is that fruit well paul speaks of the fruit of the spirit being love joy peace patience etc all of these are things that are manifest in the actions that we carry out if a person claims to believe in jesus christ but does not do the things christ commanded i dare say that they really don t have any faith asking which is more important faith or works is like asking which blade on a pair of scissors is most important or like asking which leg of your pants is more important good works should come out of and be a result of our faith to have faith true faith in christ requires you to do what he commands the parable above speaks allegorically of a person who does bear no fruit christs commands are actions and if we don t do those actions and produce fruit then we shall be uprooted just like the tree it is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it actions prove our faith and show the genuineness of it i can sit and talk for days about the fact that i have so much faith in my ability to jump off a building and not hit the ground in other words i can sit and tell you all day long that i have faith in my ability to fly i really don t have that faith though unless i am willing to jump off the roof and take the test words and talk mean nothing i could go on and give more scriptures and if people want me to i will but this should be sufficient hope it helped jon sig file broken please try later
