 from db seven n andrew cmu edu d andrew byler subject deuterocanonicals esp sirach organization freshman civil engineering carnegie mellon pittsburgh pa lines one three two dave davis writes let my state my point as provocatively as possible after going through several study bibles i m leaning heavily towards the assertion that sirach the wisdom of ben sira or ecclesiasticus is directly referenced by james in fact i think sirach is more directly referenced by james than job or ruth is referenced in any nt verse i ve seen good point the new testament does not quote ezra nehemiah esther ruth job ecclesiastes or song of songs just as it does not quote from the deuterocanon but if the non quotation of the former does not disqualify them neither does the non quotation of the later and the wisodm of solomon was quite clearly an influence on st paul especially in the letter to the romans cf especially romans one one eight three two and wisdom one three one four stuff deleted i think everyone would agree that principles that cannot be consistently applied are not very useful as principles so if we are to exclude them not accord them the authority of scripture we would appear to require other reasons what might these reasons be tradition always a fav with episcop tradition is equivocal on this subject sirach i believe is in vaticanus sinaiticus i don t know if it is listed in the muratorian canon the oldest list i know of sirach and the others are discussed by the fathers as scripture but not unanimously true not all accepted them as scripture though niether were all the books of the new testament so accepted which puts to the lie the whole argument of the books being excluded because they were debated and not universally accepted hebrews the apocalypse two peter esther and others were debated at various times but eventually retained as for the codexes you mention both vaticanus and sinaitcus include the deuterocanon bothe of the new and old testaments and vaticanus i think inlcudes one clement the shepard of hermas and the epistle of baranabas as for the muratorian canon it deals with the new testament only though it is very valuable in its witness to those books my interim conclusion is that protestant exclusion of at least one of these writings is one of those traditions of men one hears of so often they were excluded during the reformation and that appears to be the reason many people continue to exclude them any takers i can be reasonable if all else fails show me where i m wrong you re not wrong it is a tradition of men to exlcude them as i will explain below that nothing be read in the church under the nmae of divine scripture except the canonical scriptures and the canoncial scriptures are genesis exodus leviticus numbers deuteronomy joshua judges ruth four books of kingdoms being one ecclesiasticus one book tobit one book judith one book of maccabees two books st damasus i pope the decree of damsus section two three eight two ad i would think this enough though more can be shown that the church has always accepted the deutero canon though parts have been disputed by various persons for if disputes involving the new testament deutero canon does not disqulaify those books i e hebrews james two peter two three john jude revelation in protestant eyes than neither should it disqulaify the old testament books and i must point out that the jews only drew up their canon in nine zero ad six zero years after the founding of the christian religion upon the cross why should we adhere to a canon that was drawn up by the faithless in reaction to the chrsitian use of the greek septuagint which includes the deutero canon as early as one five zero ad st justin had already accused the jews of mutilating the canon of scripture by their removal of certain books protestants apparently prefer to think that god s revelation was limited by a decree of the jews in the ordering of their the jews faithless canon and that he could not use other people like the apostles in drawing up the canon the apostles were most certain users of the septuagint as some eight zero of the old testament quotes use the wording of the septuagint and not the hebrew and the septuagint includes the deuterocanon
