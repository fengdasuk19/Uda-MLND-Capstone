 from shd two zero zero one andy bgsu edu sherlette dixon subject was jesus black organization bgsu lines four three the people who post to this particular newsgroup are either too cowardly too arrogant or too apathetic to discuss this issue since i have yet to see any discussion grace my computer screen while it holds particular interest to the african american community everyone has something to gain from discussing it as any knowledgable person should know christianity has been used in this country to tighten the spiritual emotional flamers need not reply sherlette p s i expect at least this type of response it doesn t matter what color his skin was his actions i am not questioning this but he walked the earth for three decades as a human this part of his existence intrigues me and as for saying that it doesn t matter to a member of a physically emancipated people who is still struggling for mental emancipation believe me it matters the general attack on the members of this group seems unjustified there has been discussion of this issue in the past we can t discuss everything at once so the fact that some specific thing hasn t been discussed recently shouldn t be taken as a sign of general cowardice arrogance or apathy in past discussions no one has been outraged by suggestions that jesus could be black and it has been suggested by a few scholars but the concensus is that he was most likely semitic as you probably know there is a tradition that portrayals of jesus in art tends to show him as one of the people thus you wouldn t be surprised to find african art showing him as black and oriental art showing him as oriental there are good reasons relating to christian devotion to think of him in such a way it s also good now and then to have that image challenged and to think of jesus as being a member of xxx where xxx is the group you least respect clh
