 from mdw three three three one zero uxa cso uiuc edu michael d walker subject re satan kicked out of heaven biblical organization university of illinois at urbana lines two seven easteee wkuvx one bitnet writes hello all i have a question about satan i was taught a long time ago that satan was really an angel of god and was kicked out of heaven because he challenged god s authority the problem is i cannot find this in the bible is it in the bible if not where did it originate wondering eddie the quick answer revelation one two seven nine and there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and his angels who fought back but he the dragon was not strong enough and they lost their place in heaven the great dragon was hurled down that ancient serpent called the devil and satan who leads the whole world astray he was hurled down to the earth and his angels with him the earlier part of chapter one two deals very symbolically with why satan rose up in battle against michael and the good angels in the first place hope this clears it up mike walker
