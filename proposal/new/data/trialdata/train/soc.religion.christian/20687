 from mussack austin ibm com christopher mussack subject re christian s need for christianity lines four four in article lmh juliet caltech edu henling lawrence m writes in article i find this view of christianity to be quite disheartening and sad the idea that life only has meaning or importance if there is a creator does not seem like much of a basis for belief please forgive all the inclusions i suppose they are neccessary to follow the argument my point is that if life has meaning or importance then we should try to find that meaning or importance which is almost a tautology i hope i m not being too patronizing one term for that meaning is creator though that is not obvious from my above argument and the logic is also appalling god must exist because i want him to it s more like i think therefore i am therefore god is i have heard this line of reasoning before and wonder how prevalent it is certainly in modern society many people are convinced life is hopeless or so the pollsters and newscasts state but i don t see where this is a good reason to become religious if you want meaning why not just join a cult such as in waco the leaders will give you the security blanket you desire unfortunately the term religious is ambiguous to me in this context i could say that searching for meaning in life is by definition being religious i could say cult followers by definition have given up on the search if you want meaning why not search for the truth so far my understanding of christianity is congruent with my understanding of truth there have been many before me who have come to conclusions that are worded in ways that make sense to me by no means does that imply that i understand everything chris mussack
