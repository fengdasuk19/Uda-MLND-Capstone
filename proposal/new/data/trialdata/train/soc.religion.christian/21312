 from rexlex fnal fnal gov subject babylon book offer organization fnal ad net lines two zero from time to time i have made reference to a book called the two babylons which is a book written by alexander hislop mid one eight zero zero s about the babylonian mystery religion and its flight through history i was unable to put it down the first time i read it but others have found it dry it has numberable references and illustrations if you are interested in purchasing your own copy you can call moody book store three one two three two nine four three five two and order it for one six nine nine and they will ship it to you it is a good book just to get the reference titles for your own digs into the mystery religions i have found it invaluable for that purpose alone but for those who only want to skim the subject it comes highly recommended just a note to my rc brothers and sisters you may find this to be a diatribe or you may find it to be a test to the origin and true nature of the origin of rcism if you are offended by anything that asks hard questions about your denomination as to whether or not it is christian then perhaps you should just passover this offer to those who are a little more adventurous go for it and later please contact me with you reasons pro or con on the scholorship of this book i really would be interested adelphoi ev christos rex
