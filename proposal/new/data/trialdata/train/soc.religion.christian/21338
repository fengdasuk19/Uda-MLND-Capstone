 from bruce liv ac uk bruce stephens subject re homosexuality issues in christianity organization centre for mathematical software research univ liverpool lines four nine on five may nine three zero six five one two three gmt shellgate llo uu four psi com larry l overacker said in article fsspr acad three alaska edu hardcore alaskan writes i hope that anyone who remembers seeing rev troy perry s performance at the one nine eight seven march on washington will see for themselves just how inconceivable it is to mix christianity with homosexuality whether or not christianity and homosexuality are compatible is clearly debatable since it is being debated in my opnion it is genuinely destuctive to the cause of christianity to use this sort of ad hominem argument to oppose one s adversaries it only serves to further drive people away from christianity because it projects and confirms the frequently held opinion that christians are unable to think critically and intelligently i agree entirely speaking as an atheist heterosexual for what it s worth this is one of the least attractive parts of some varieties of christianity although i m sure it s possible to argue theologically that we shouldn t make analogies between discrimination on the basis of sex and race and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation morally the case looks unanswerable for those outside religion the three forms are analogous we shouldn t discriminate on the basis of sex race or sexual orientation i found the moderator s faqs on the subject instructive and recommend everyone to read them there seem to be three different levels of acceptance one regard homosexual orientation as a sin or evil whatever two regard homosexual behaviour as a sin but accept orientation though presumably orientation is unfortunate and dislike people who indulge three as two but love the sinner four accept homosexuality altogether my experience is that three is the most common attitude i imagine one and two are limited to a few fundamentalist sects i suppose i can go along with three except that i have this feeling that a one four one five year old living in a community with this attitude on discovering that they were more attracted to members of the same sex would not feel the love of the community but would rather feel the pressure not to exhibit their feelings i m not saying that the community in particular the parents would not love the child but i suspect the child would not feel loved bruce cmsr university of liverpool
