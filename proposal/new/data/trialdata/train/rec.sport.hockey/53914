zero one three six two nine six two min bill ranford stopped three six shots to lead canada to a four one victory in a very well played game the first period started with a give away from a canadian defenseman and rundqvist came in alone on ranford but couldn t put the puck over a sliding ranford later on kevin dineen had a great opportunity but soderstrom played very well too stefan nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up jan larsson but again ranford came up big period ended scoreless but the edge to sweden in creating more opportunities second period action saw tommy soderstrom making a great save mark recchi made a backhanded cross ice pass to lindros eric one timed the puck but soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save at the seven minute mark canada started applying pressure on the swedes sanderson dineen brind amour worked hard and kept the puck in the swedes zone dineen gave the puck to sanderson who skated around a screened swedish defenseman came in on soderstrom and made a wrist shot that went it by soderstrom s far post one zero canada the swedes picked up their game after that and peter forsberg had a shot that hit ranford s post the inside went parallel to the goal line and out then gartner got a penalty and the swedes a power play jan larsson took a shot from the slot ranford gave a rebound to larsson who saw juhlin by the far post passed the puck and ranford was beat one one third period started as the other periods swedes having most of the pressure but the canadians always dangerous once they were close to the swede goal at five five four canada created some great chances and arto blomsten was forced to cover the puck in the swede goal crease since soderstrom lost sight of it that resulted in a penalty shot since a defenseman can t cover the puck in the goal crease geoff sanderson took the penalty shot his first ever he explained afterwards and he put it low on soderstrom s stick side close to the post excellent penalty shot to give canada a go ahead goal canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside gartner volleyed a bouncing puck past soderstrom to make it three one the swedes ran out of gas then and couldn t produce as good scoring chances as they had for two five periods the four one goal came with only one second left rod brind amour scoring on a rebound from soderstrom where the swedish defense already had their minds in the dressing room a very good game the best in the wc so far with both goalies playing great soderstrom best player in sweden but ranford even played better than soderstrom that tells you something about ranford probably the best goalie in the world were some comments after the game canada played a very disciplined defense ranford pointed out that it is easy to play well with a good defense lindros played a lot and played well sanderson naturally game hero with two goals the forsberg naslund bergqvist line sweden s best along with larsson juhlin nilsson swedish defense played well one nine seven cm one zero four kg peter popovic had the task of neutralizing one nine two cm one zero seven kg eric lindros and managed this very well ranger defenseman peter andersson finally got to go to the wc and considering that he landed in germany just a few hours before the game he played very well swedish coach curt lundmark was irritated after the game partly because of the swedes inability to score and partly because of the linesman s mistake on the one three goal lines information follows further below italy switzerland one zero zero zero one zero zero
