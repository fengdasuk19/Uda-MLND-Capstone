 from karim edvard ahmed subject re truly a sad day for hockey organization senior economics carnegie mellon pittsburgh pa lines one seven nntp posting host po five andrew cmu edu in reply to a fine two six year history came to a close tonight as the minnesota north stars or norm s stars whichever you prefer lost to the red wings by a score of five three the stars goals were scored by mike mcphee and ulf dahlen who netted two including the final one in franchise history with less than a minute to play yes it s a shame that the nhl lost a fine team in one of the best hockey markets in the country being a north stars fan it is sad to see all of the tradition of the last two six years get thrown into oblivion at the hands of a truly crappy owner hopefully the nhl will install an expansion franchise in the twin cities within the next five years even if this is the case a lot has been lost in the north stars move kea
