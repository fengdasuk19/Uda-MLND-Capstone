picked it up and advanced towards the finnish goal and shot a nice hard wrist shot in ketterer s top corner ville siren s slap shot from the blue line on power play made it one one and juha riihijarvi scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal put the puck high over aslin one two after the first period the finns started the second period with really good pressure korpisalo made it one three with another goal from close range high over aslin then during the finnish pressure sweden turned the game around in one four seven mikael renberg worked hard behind the finnish goal and passed the puck to jan larsson in front who backhanded the puck low two three rundqvist entered the finnish zone and passed to ahlund and the finnish defense let ahlund skate in and take a shot that ketterer dropped into the goal three three next roger hansson behind the goal sent the puck back to the blue line where roger akerstrom took a slap shot and ketterer didn t see the puck since there was traffic in front four three third period started with a nice goal by stefan the shadow nilsson stefan and patrik juhlin entered the finnish zone patrik passed the puck back to stefan who alone with ketterer made no mistake five three then keijo sailynoja show started he reduce and equalized the lead in only two one seconds first he scored the five four goal and after that he came in alone with aslin but was tripped by aslin to get a penalty shot sailynoja made a nice penalty shot showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot the swedes seemed to head for a win when mikael renberg scored the six five goal late in the game on a nice power play combination renberg waited in the slot showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side ahlund passed the puck and renberg took a turnaround shot low in ketterer s goal s far side but jari korpisalo had other plans as he only two eight seconds later scored the game s final goal to make it six six korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow angle that maybe aslin should have saved all in all a decent game where the defense wasn t the best both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period to try no combinations renberg and rundqvist plays well together in the swedish team larsson nilsson juhlin best line overall again it seems to be a working wc line stillman good on defense some players aren t good enough for the wc though hakan ahlund faell ner hjaelmen och jobba roger hansson challe berglund kenny jonsson will likely have to leave for nhl pros two goal scorers jari korpisalo and keijo sailynoja played well in the finnish team markus ketterer didn t have a very good game we ve seen him a lot better so lindfors is probably finland s starting goalie in the wc i heard that esa tikkanen will join the finnish team it would be inter resting to know which other pros coach matikainen counts on for the wc starting lines sweden finland three five peter aslin three zero markus
