 from nlu xenon stanford edu nelson lu subject sharks review part five left wings organization computer science department stanford university lines one six one apparently part two defensemen numbered two through one nine was lost when i posted it to make things worse i lost my own copy i have asked on the sharks mailing list on which it did get out to see if someone can mail me a copy back if someone responds i will repost it when i get it otherwise i will re write it in a day or two and post it sorry about that eight larry depalma season three rd acquired nine one nine two free agent from minnesota grade i c d no netter fan watching the sharks including me knows where depalma was at the end of the season the sharks appeared to still have his rights but he wasn t in san jose he wasn t in kansas city and his name hasn t appeared on the waiver wire and that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part for depalma after being called up october three zero against the tampa bay lightning depalma had an excellent week scoring five points in three games while playing good defense unfortunately the two seven year old depalma then disappeared the rest of the way getting just three more points in one five more games and generally looked lethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice he then was sent down to kansas city walked out from there and was suspended and later reinstated when it was revealed that he was injured he then promptly disappeared from the watching eyes of shark bytes as the mailing list is now known to sharks officials faithful and neither the sharks nor we miss him one zero johan garpenlov season three rd acquired nine one nine two trade with detroit for d bob mcgill and eight th round pick in nine two entry draft from vancouver grade a a after an early slump garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest of the way finishing with six six points in seven nine games second highest total on the team as he clicked well with team mvp kelly kisio and right wing rob gaudreau kisio got most of the credit but garpenlov finishing second in the mvp voting clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills as he was seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him by putting the puck past opposing goaltenders getting a club high one four power play goals contrary to his previous rep garpenlov also showed that despite his small size five one one one eight three lbs he was willing to throw himself around when necessary albeit not very successful yet he also still needs to work on his defense although he improved tremendously throughout the season and was actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season he will be a major key to the offense next year one five david bruce season five th acquired nine one nine two from st louis in expansion draft grade i after a banner nine one nine two when he led the team in power play goals one zero and was third in total scoring three eight points in six zero games bruce was bothered virtually all of this season with a groin injury which kept him out of the lineup for all by one seven games this season of course it is difficult to speculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by the injury but the two eight year old bruce was effective with a man up or a man short in the sharks first season and was expected to be a strong offensive leader this season as well the injury appears serious which is a shame because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now instead his future with the sharks next season appears clouded one eight mark pederson season three rd acquired nine two nine three trade with philadelphia for c lw dave snuggerud grade i b it is difficult for me to understand the flyers decision to unload pederson after a very good offensive season last season four zero points in five eight games but after riding the pine early in the season pederson was summarily sent to the sharks in exchange of the defensive minded snuggerud and he finished with four one games combined with the flyers and the sharks he was also limited by injuries this season and this limited his production one seven points but when healthy pederson appears impressive with a good scoring touch good size and the willingness to throw it around although he s not considered a physical forward and good speed he also does not appear to be a liability on defense but the sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how much exactly pederson can do two zero john carter season four th acquired nine one nine two free agent from boston grade i b b carter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team and the hard work worked wonders as at times he looked great on ice however although he did look great at times the fact that he received just one six points in five five games for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can do and the sharks confirmed that by sending him to kansas city with about two zero games left in the season carter who will turn three zero on may six always hussled but as a result was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive zone while forechecking but he was generally a credit on the defensive end but he is probably of limited utility in that capacity and he did not impress offensively although he was one of the best sharks at drawing penalties he is very unlikely to be back next season two eight jean francois quintin season one st acquired nine one nine two from minnesota in dispersal draft grade i b b i don t understand why the sharks didn t let quintin play any more than the one four games he played this season he was generally hard working and creating opportunities offensively and appeared at age two three ready for regular nhl duty at least for a team like the sharks finishing with seven points in those one four games while not being a defensive liability shoulder injury in training camp before the nine one nine two season limited quintin the team s leading scorer in exhibition games despite sitting out the final two to just two nine games with the sharks and the blades that season but he looked impressive he should be a solid contender for regular duty next season four one mark beaufait season one st acquired two nd round pick in one nine nine one supplemental draft grade i after a all star season at kansas city beaufait got a cup of coffey with the sharks late in the season when the blades knocked down a playoff spot and the sharks decimated with injuries playing five games and scoring a goal for his only nhl point thus far despite small size five nine one six five lbs beaufait was not shy to throw himself around when necessary and looked pretty good at times although it s too early to judge him based on five nhl games in which he played mostly left wing away from his center position at northern michigan and kansas city four two jaroslav otevrel season one st acquired eight th round pick in one nine nine one entry draft grade i like beaufait otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was up for his cup of tea seven games midway through the season he was generally very much of a defensive liability and did not show much offensively either although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those seven games he may need another season to work on his defense but once his defense is acceptable he should be ready four four michel picard season one st acquired nine two nine three trade with hartford for lw yvon corriveau grade i b c the two three year old picard although he perennially tore up the minors seems to be close to being out of chances for some reason after being acquired by the sharks but failing to impress the management in two five games scoring four goals for his only points and he spent most of the rest of the way in kansas city he was not particularly strong defensively and despite his offensive brilliance in the minors he has failed thus far to score in the nhl although he has been given limited opportunities he may be the sharks bait in the expansion draft four five dody wood season one st acquired three rd round pick in one nine nine one entry draft grade i d d although perhaps i shouldn t give a grade at all i have been accused of knocking on wood too much then it is probably no surprise to you that i am thoroughly unimpressed by wood thus far although one three games is a small example he was generally a nonfactor on offense was not particularly good defensively and took too many silly penalties losing many fights in the process and gathering six nine penalty minutes in those one three games projecting to to four four six in an eight four game season he s not ready and needs at least another season at kc where he can work on his fighting skills if nothing else his relatively small size five one one one eight one lbs does not give much possibility that he can survive at this stage as an enforcer go calgary flames al macinnis for norris gary roberts for hart and smythe go edmonton oilers go for playoffs next year stay in edmonton
