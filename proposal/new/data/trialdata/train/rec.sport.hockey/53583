puck at the flyers blue line and nylander stripped him and took off the recchi goal was a two on one with lindros the bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net got a good carom and it ended up behind the goalie on the second nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in this is the most frustrating part of the flyers defense take the body and if they get one shot and beat you fine don t give them another chance carkner galley and mcgill are all terrible about this i ll bet money at least one of them was the closest flyer to the play that s all i have my radio got bad after that and i was lucky to know who it was that scored much less how from what i heard roussel had a very strong game after the game gene hart asked bobby taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the game it was garry galley three for his career high point total i m surprised that a former goalie wouldn t look closer at his defensive play tommy soderstrom two for his team record tying five shutouts in only about one two a season and mark recchi one for his all time high team single season scoring mark but here s the odd part he couldn t decide between lindros and recchi for number one if he picks recchi as one after he had a hard time choosing between him and lindros doesn t that make lindros two what you wanna know my three stars of the season well since you asked one eric lindros eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice the difference between the team s record with him and without him is no accident i believe that the team could have been almost as successful without recchi there is no question that this team is significantly better with eric lindros on it and i think that he will deservedly wear the c on his jersey next season two tommy soderstrom five shutouts was second in the league to only ed belfour and tommy didn t have a chris chelios booo in front of him he also didn t play a complete season due to heart problems sentimental edge here my family has a history of heart problems there s no question in my mind that tommy soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future and if roussel complains again about being number two look for him to be traded within two years three mark recchi again you can t argue with an all time team high single season scoring mark there are an awful lot of teams that didn t have a single player get as many points plus mark is the only flyer to play the entire season not a tough choice honorable mentions rod brind amour topped his single season high point total which he set last year the difference was that he wasn t on the top line this year and didn t get as much playing time then again he didn t get the defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either dimtri yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman yes he made rookie mistakes but he was usually fast enough to make up for them i have a feeling that with his shot he ll score a few more points next year without giving up anything in his own zone and i suspect that he ll be the teams top defenseman in years to come garry galley was the team s point leader from defensemen again there are some things you just can t argue with and he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game and that was against his wishes under doctors orders but his defensive play often negates his offensive contribution a little more caution and a little bit smarter in his own end will make him a much more important part of the team next year brent fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total but consistency became a problem for him a couple misc notes mostly for mailing list members tom misnik a member of the mailing list would
