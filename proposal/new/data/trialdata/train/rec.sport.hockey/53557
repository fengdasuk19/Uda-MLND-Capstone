 from gballent hudson uvic ca greg ballentine subject re plus minus stat nntp posting host hudson uvic ca reply to gballent hudson uvic ca organization university of victoria victoria bc canada lines five zero in article one six seven six mala bc ca apland mala bc ca ron apland writes in article gballent vancouver uvic ca greg ballentine writes to adjust one first calculate a teams goals scored pp goals scored goals allowed pp goals allowed when they were penalty killing two divide this number by five to take into account of the fact that there are five players on the ice and each is one five responsible for the team three a players adjusted is his raw team adjustment btw if anyone could calculate and post adjusted ratings it would be greatly appreciated i might find the time to do so but don t count on it i have a database filter set up for the player stats when it is posted for the end of season i ll repost the team averages you don t need to go through the complicated team adjustment you are using all you need is the team average by summing all the individual players and divide by the total number of players on the team this will be a little distorted because the players who have been traded recently will have come with scores based on their original teams this shouldn t distort it too bad though if you want to look at individual players from this perspective then go ahead you ll require the original player stats though question if a team uses four zero players in a season do you merely divide the total by four zero if so a player who plays in only one game is considered equally valuable as a player who plays in all of them another way of looking at the same thing is to compare the deviation from the mean for the team of the player to the standard deviation for the team i ll post both since the standard deviation for each team is different i am unsure how transferable between teams that these stats are shouldn t the average standard deviation in the league be used i am interested in seeing each method but i still think that mine is the best if for no other reason than familiarity gregmeister
