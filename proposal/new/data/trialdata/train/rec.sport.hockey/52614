any team on any night showed up at the spectrum sunday night and dominated the maple leafs thoroughly en route to a four zero shutout tommy soderstrom will get credit for the shutout but he barely broke a sweat until the third period as the flyers defense kept the leafs from mounting any serious attack injuries pelle eklund is day to day with a bruised thigh roster moves jason bowen was added to the lineup for his first nhl game jason was the flyers second pick in the first round one five th overall of the one nine nine two entry draft one nine years old six four two one zero lbs in six two games with the tri city americans he had one zero goals one two assists and two one nine pim he plays left wing and defense he played defense in this game although bobby taylor said that bill dineen was planning to use him up front as well andre faust was returned to hershey he actually left after the second period of the kings game flew to albany got the game tying goal in a bears ot win and played again for hershey sunday night lines fedyk lindros recchi beranek brind amour dineen lomakin butsayev conroy acton brown galley mcgill yushkevich cronin carkner hawgood bowen tommy soderstrom in goal acton replaced lomakin in the three rd period game summary if the flyers played like this every night they d be in the playoffs this year the flyers hit everything that moved they created scoring chance after scoring chance they snuffed out everything that the leafs tried to do jason bowen made a good play on his first nhl shift that almost created a goal he had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone but instead of taking the shot he found brind amour crashing the net on the other side a perfect pass and a good shot across daren puppa s body should have been a goal but puppa made a great save reading the play garry galley gave the maple leafs seven th ranked power play the first chance when he hooked doug gilmour at four two five the flyers lowly two one st ranked penalty killing unit was almost flawless the entire game and set the tone on this kill the maple leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots and the defense swept away every rebound after the power play the flyers got a goal on an ugly play rod brind amour gave the puck to greg hawgood at the right point and he sent a drive at the net puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of josef beranek and bob rouse who were wrestling in the slot beranek was able to get his stick on the puck and push it out to dineen who was skating into the slot from the right circle and he lifted a backhander over puppa for a one zero flyers lead at eight one zero the flyers kept the pressure on and puppa was the only leaf keeping the flyers from building on their lead for a while eventually things settled down and defense prevailed each team got an occasional scoring chance but the goalies were strong bowen started giving some lindros like checks in his own corners then lindros who was looking to avenge a hit foligno gave him thought he had a chance to even the score he had foligno lined up at center ice leaned into him and rode him into the center ice boards the only problem was that foligno was a little far from the boards and mike mister mcgeough felt that it warranted a boarding call at one five three eight the leafs couldn t get anything going on the power play as the flyers were very aggressive for a change on the kill with time running out in the period recchi carried through the neutral zone and handed to lindros as they approached the leaf s blue line they were in a crowd with wendell clark and jamie macoun lindros tried a backhand pass to recchi through the feet of macoun that connected to recchi but then clark checked recchi off the puck macoun then tried to clear but it was weak and went right to mcgill who had manned the point he drove it from just inside the blue line macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own goalie at one nine five five one shots were one three eight flyers in the period the flyers finally got their first chance on the power play when dave andreychuk tripped up rod brind amour in his offensive zone during the power play the flyers got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and eric gloved it down but mcgeough thought it hit his stick above his head we could see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove and the replay confirmed but the faceoff went to the other end as time was running out in the advantage lindros found galley with a pass across the goal mouth but puppa made the save the rebound kicked back to the right corner where recchi picked it up passed it out to eric crashing through the right circle and eric one timed past puppa at seven five five with the assist recchi moves past bobby clarke s seven four seven five season the second best one season total for a flyer at one one seven eric moves up to four th all time in flyers rookie scoring with six seven points mike eastwood took down al conroy at eight three zero to give the flyers another chance on the power play not much pressure before garry galley ended the power play with a slash at nine one nine not much happened on the four on four although the leafs had most of the possession the flyers smothered the leafs short power play tempers flared a little at one three one four bowen and pearson got roughing minors keith acton got a bloody face dave mcllwain then took a dive and got greg hawgood a hooking minor at one three four six to set up a four on three the replay showed that hawgood s stick stopped making contact with mcllwain long before he spun around and fell again the flyers smothered the leafs power play led by dimitri yushkevich bowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on pearson berehowski tried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball he had the puck at the point and just trickled a pass down the slot he made all the flyers look silly as nobody could get a stick on it and it got to gilmour at the side of the net but soderstrom stoned him the flyers picked things up offensively after the kill was over but didn t get anything home shots were one three one zero flyers the flyers were content with the three goal lead in the third period and they decided that if tommy wanted a shutout he was going to have to work for it a little the flyers got most of the scoring chances in the first seven or so minutes of the period but couldn t get past puppa then the leafs got tired of lindros making road kill out of them and tempers flared two each for doug gilmour and lindros unsportsmanlike conduct and two each for glenn anderson and mcgill roughing all at seven zero two terry carkner then took a kneeing penalty at seven five one on gilmour again the flyers smothered the leafs power play at about the one two minute mark dave andreychuk got a shot away from his left circle that got through soderstrom the puck was rolling on it s side and as luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards it think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the other seconds later rod brind amour tripped up gilmour at one two two four to give the leafs another chance on the power play on the advantage after soderstrom stoned andreychuk while lying down andreychuk got the rebound through soderstrom but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept away by one of his defensemen they kept the pressure on but soderstrom was equal and preserved the shutout recchi cross checked ken baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl at one six zero one no punches thrown recchi got the initial minor krushelnyski baumgartner and lindros each got roughing minors at one seven zero two rouse and beranek expressed their mutual dislike for each other and got two each for slashing to set up another four on four mike eastwood shoved down ryan mcgill in the flyers zone as they were battling for the puck and while mcgill was down he ran his stick across mcgill s face the flyers were not happy with that at all five eight al conroy paired up with six one berehowski and started throwing punches upward well al held his own much to the delight of the crowd each got a couple punches in before going down in a head and al got a standing o penalties eastwood five cross check game clark carkner one zero each berehowski and conroy five each fighting at one seven four nine so a major penalty for the rest of the game for the flyers the had no interest in stting on the lead hawgood galley and brind amour played catch until hawgood found dineen all alone in the left circle he controlled the puck and blasted it past puppa at one eight three nine that was all the fireworks tommy soderstrom would not face another shot puppa did but kept the flyers off the board four zero flyers shots were nine eight flyers in the three rd probably the strongest game i ve seen from the flyers since the all star break shutout number four for soderstrom all since one one zero tied for two nd most in the nhl but he s played fewer games than belfour six or the goalie i can t remember that he s tied with next up it s the winnipeg selannes tuesday night in winnipeg the flyers cannot be eliminated if they win but a loss coupled with an islander win that night in washington would be the official end flyers up to seven one points on the season in seven eight games last year they had seven five points in eight zero games five under five zero zero so they need at least eight points in their last six games to improve on that only by percentage points five under in eight four is better than five under in eight zero tragic number holds at three points with six games left the tragic number for five th is five points i watched the rangers blow a four two third period lead at home to lose five four before i finished this up why five points instead of four well the flyers will win the tie breaker if they catch them whereas the islanders win tie breakers against the flyers and so need only a tie the rangers could crumble down the stretch as they play the devils the pens twice the flyers and finish up with two games against the caps so i guess five th place could be the goal for the team to focus on flyers team record watch eric
