nine three los angeles kings notes playoffs stauber disturbed by third man theme by rick sadowski daily news barry melrose s decision to stick robb stauber in the stands rather than in the crease or even on the bench for the stanley cup playoffs does not sit well with the rookie goaltender i want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year the most fun time of the year and i m not stauber said with some emotion monday i think i have worked hard enough for that stauber said he accepts melrose s choice of kelly hrudey as the teams top goalie in their playoff series with the calgary flames hrudey made two one saves in sundays six three opening victory but stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the no three man behind rick knickle stauber had a four one two record and two nine eight goals against average down the stretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the no one job from hrudey knickle he won two of three decisions but had a bloated five two six average twice was yanked from games once for stomach cramps and hasn t played since march two nine yet when the series resumes wednesday knickle will serve as hrudey s backup again and stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on olympic saddledome popcorn if i m supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter i dropped too three what happened to no two stauber wondered not that i d be happy with no two but i feel i should at least be a part of this team in the playoffs perhaps stauber eventually will get his chance but melrose apparently is not convinced the two five year old is capable of handling playoff pressure while insisting he is the kings goalie of the future melrose said stauber flubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season they were according to melrose a seven two loss to san jose on dec two six an eight three loss to the new york rangers on jan two three a six six tie with detroit on feb one one an eight six loss to vancouver on thursday four times this season robb could have emerged as the elite goalie he could have taken it away from kelly hrudey and he didn t do it melrose said an elite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him the mark of a great goalie is that he isn t satisfied to be a backup i m not blaming robb for the losses but if you re going to be no one you ve got to be able to walk your talk you ve got to be able to play when everything is on the line robb stauber has a great deal of ability but maybe i expect more from him than he does ouch that remark stung stauber he began the season nine zero one struggled when the team hit a mid season slump didn t play for a month after knickle was signed off the san diego gulls roster then came on at the end i expect more from myself than anybody including barry melrose said stauber a three year star at the university of minnesota who left school in one nine eight nine only to have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries what i ve been through the last four years two knee operations a herniated disk in my back shoulder surgery what more can i go through i obviously do expect a lot from myself otherwise i wouldn t be here anybody who would disagree with that doesn t know me i m not saying barry doesn t know me but don t say i ve been without expectations if anything i m a perfectionist stauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games melrose mentioned but even though i didn t play well i get knocked down from maybe on to three it s a bit of a jump he said you re almost no one or if you play a good game you re no one and if you don t you re no three why does jack nicklaus shoot a six seven and then a seven five can you explain that that s what barry wanted me to explain to him why i didn t come through when he counted on me i don t know what i do know is it s a sport i ll be there melrose s goalie of the future statement doesn t mean much to stauber before you know it i ll be three zero and there will be no future he said game one of the kings flames playoff series drew a four two nielsen rating on abc channel seven here in la the kings averaged a two
