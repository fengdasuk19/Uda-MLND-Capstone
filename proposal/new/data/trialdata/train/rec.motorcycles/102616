high tech industry professionals to public access electronic bulletin board users currently rec motorcycles pronounced wreck dot motorcycles it s the file name for the group s primary on line meeting place carries about two two five zero articles per month it is read by an estimated two nine zero zero zero people most of the frequent posters belong to a motorcycle club the denizens of doom usually referred to as the dod the dod started when motorcyclist john r nickerson wrote a couple of parodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes fellow computer enthusiast bruce robinson posted these articles under the pen name denizen of doom a while later chuck rogers signed off as dod nr zero zero zero three keeper of the flame bruce was then designated dod nr zero zero zero two retroactively and of course nickerson the originator of the parodies was given dod nr zero zero zero one the idea of a motorcycle club with no organization no meetings and no rules appealed to many so john sloan dod nr zero zero one one became keeper of the list issuing dod numbers to anyone who wanted one to date there have been almost four zero zero memberships issued to people all over the united states and canada as well as australia new zealand the united kingdom france germany norway and finland keeper of the list sloan eventually designed a club patch the initial run of three zero zero patches sold out immediately the profits from this went to the american motorcycle heritage foundation another amhf fund raiser selling denizens of doom pins to members was started by arnie skurow a few months later again the project was successful and the profits were donated to the foundation so far the denizens have contributed over one five zero zero to the ama museum a plaque in the name of the denizens of doom now hangs in the motorcycle heritage museum as often as possible the dod ers crawl out from behind their crts and go riding together it turns out that the two largest concentrations of dod ers are centered near denver boulder colorado and in california s silicon valley consequently two major events are the annual assault on rollins pass in colorado and the northern versus southern california joust the ride and feed is a bike trip over rollins pass followed by a big barbecue dinner the concept for the joust is to have riders from northern california ride south riders from southern california to ride north meeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle an additional plan for one nine nine one is to hold an official denizens of doom homecoming in conjunction with the ama heritage homecoming in columbus ohio in july though it s a safe bet the the denizens of doom and their collective communications hub rec motorcycles will not replace the more traditional motorcycle organizations for those who prowl the electronic pathways in search of two wheeled camaraderie it s a great way for kindred spirits to get together long may they flame live to flame flame to live centerbar this official motto of the denizens of doom refers to the ease with which you can gratuitously insult someone electronically when you would not do anything like that face to face these insults are known as flames issuing them is called flaming flames often start when a member disagrees with something another member has posted over the network a typical sophisticated intelligent form of calm reasoned rebuttal would be something like what an incredibly stupid statement you spandex clad poseur this will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense of the original poster describing just what they think of you your riding ability and your cat the denizens of doom the saga unfolds by john sloan dod zero zero one one periodically the question what is dod is raised this is one of those questions in the same class as why is the sky blue if there is a god why is there so much suffering in the world and why do women inevitably tell you that you re such a nice guy just before they dump you the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism tradition and philosophy questions that have inspired research and discussion by philosophers in locker rooms motorcycle service bays and in the halls of academe for generations a long long time ago in computer time where anything over a few minutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem on a computer far far away on the net topologically speaking two machines in the same room in atlanta might route mail to one another via a system in chicago a chap who wished to remain anonymous but who was eventually assigned the dod membership one wrote a satire of the various personalities and flame wars of rec motorcycles and signed it the denizen of doom not wishing to identify himself he asked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time become dod two to post it for him dod two not really giving a whit about what other people thought and generally being a right thinking individual did so flaming and other amusements followed he who would become the holder of dod membership three thought this was the funniest thing he d seen in a while being the sort that is pretty easily amused so he claimed membership in the denizens of doom motorcycle club and started signing his postings with his membership number perhaps readers of rec motorcycles were struck with the vision of a motorcycle club with no dues no rules no restrictions as to brand or make or model or national origin of motorcycle a club organized electronically it may well be that readers were yearning to become a part of something that would provide them with a greater identity a gestalt personality something in which the whole was greater than the sum of its parts it could also be that we re all computer nerds who wear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors who just happen to also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight ratios social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open minded enough to accept us as members in a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy the denizens of doom motorcycle club was born a club in which the majority of members have never met one another face to face and perhaps like it that way yet feel that they know one another pretty well or well enough given some of the electronic personalities in the newsgroup a club organized and run in the loosest sense of the word by volunteers through the network via electronic news and mail with a membership mailing list often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the same region a motto a logo a series of photo albums circulating around the country organized by dod nine club patches organized by one one and even an mtv style music video produced by four seven and distributed on vhs by one eight where will it end who knows will the dod start sanctioning races placing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on board engine management computers will the dod organize poker runs where each participant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards will the dod have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal room and at least a three eight six sized unix system only time will tell the dod has no dues no rules and no requirements other than net access and a love for motorcycles to become a member one need only ask although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few really good club secrets new members will receive via email a membership number and the latest copy of the membership list which includes name state and email address the denizens of doom motorcycle club will live forever or at least until next year when we may decided to change the name live to flame flame to live the dod daemon as seen on the

you are doomed to riding bigot doing donuts and evading the police terrorizing old ladies and raping small children eating small dogs for tea and large dogs for dinner in short i want to be a denizen chuck rips off his lab coat revealing black leather jacket with fringe boots and cap scene simultaneously changes to the top of an obviously assaulted rollins pass a small throng of hell s angels sit on their harleys in the near background gunning their engines showering lookers on with nails as they turn donuts and leaking oil on the tarmac chuck is standing in front of a heavily chromed fat boy chuck sings to the tune of the lumberjack song i m a denizen and i m okay i flame all night and i ride all day hell s angels echo chorus surprisingly heavy on tenors he s a denizen and he s okay he flames all night and he rides all day i ride my bike i eat my lunch i go to the lavat ry on wednesdays i ride skyline running children down with glee chorus he rides his bike he eats his lunch he goes to the lavat ry on wednesdays he rides skyline running children down with glee chorus refrain cause he s a denizen i ride real fast my name is chuck it somehow seems to fit i over rate the worst bad f ck but like a real good sh t oh i m a denizen and i m okay i flame all night and i ride all day chorus refrain oh he s a denizen i wear high heels and bright pink shorts full leathers and a bra i wish i rode a harley just like my dear mama chorus refrain why you have to be killed well the first thing you have to understand just in case you managed to read this far and still not figure it out is that the dod started as a joke and in the words of one denizen it intends to remain one sometime in the far distant past a hapless newbie asked what does dod stand for it s not the department of defense is it naturally a denizen who had watched the movie top gun a few times too many rose to the occasion and replied that s classified we could tell you but then we d have to kill you and the rest is history a variation on the security theme is to supply disinformation about what dod stands for notable contributions and contributers where known include daughters of democracy dod two three doers of donuts dancers of despair dod nine debasers of daughters dickweeds of denver driveway of death debauchers of donuts dumpers of dirtbikes note that this is not a comprehensive list as variations appear to be limited only by the contents of one s imagination or dictionary file the rec moto photo archive first a bit of history this all started with ilana stern and chuck rogers organizing a rec motorcycles photo album many copies were made and several sets were sent on tours around the world only to vanish in unknown locations then bruce tanner decided that it would be appropriate for an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album bruce has not only provided the disk space and ftp a directory listing three uuencoded parts of bruce tanner gif and the dodframe ps file in ascii oh wildcards are allowed but a maximum of two zero mail messages rounded up to the next whole file are send a send dod gif would send one five zero files of five zero k each not a good idea bruce tanner two one three eight six zero two four five one x five nine six tanner cerritos edu cerritos college norwalk ca cerritos tanner a couple of comments bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this so why not drop him a note if you find the rec moto photo archive useful second since bruce has provided the server as a favor it would be kind of you to access it after normal working hours california time patches what patches you may have heard mention of various dod trinkets such as patches pins and your reaction was probably i want or that s sick or perhaps that s sick i want well there s some good news and some bad news the good news is that there s been an amazing variety of dod labeled widgets created the bad news is that there isn t anywhere you can buy any of them this isn t because of any exclusivity attempt but simply because there is no dod store that keeps a stock all of the creations have been done by individual denizens out of their own pockets the typical procedure is someone says i m thinking of having a dod frammitz made they ll cost xx xx with xx xx going to the ama museum anyone want one then orders are taken and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the pre paid orders is produced and quickly consumed so if you want a dod doodad act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one or produce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling after all this is anarchy in action here s a possibly incomplete list of known dod merchandise and perpetrators patches dod one one pins dod nine nine stickers dod nine nine motorcycle license plate frames dod two one six t shirts dod nine nine polo shirts dod one two two zippo lighters dod nine nine ltf ftl belt buckles dod nine nine and patches dod nine nine a second batch was done and rapidly consumed by popular demand all profits have been donated to the american motorcyclist association motorcycle heritage museum as of june one nine nine two over five five zero zero dollars has been contributed to the museum fund by the dod if you visit the museum you ll see a large plaque on the founders wall in the name of denizens of doom usenet the world complete with a dod
