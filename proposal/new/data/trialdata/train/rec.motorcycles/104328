 from erick andr ub com eric a kilpatrick subject re drinking and riding nntp posting host pixel andr ub com reply to erick andr ub com organization ungermann bass inc andover ma lines seven personally i follow the no alcohol rule when i m on a bike my view is that you have to be in such a high degree of control that any alcohol could be potentially hazardous to my bike if i get hurt it s my own fault but i don t want to wreck my katana i developed this philosophy from an impromptu experiment i had one beer at six zero zero in the evening and had volleyball practice at seven zero zero i wasn t even close to leagle intoxication but i couldn t perform even the most basic things until eight three zero this made me think about how i viewed alcohol and intoxication you may seem fine but your reactions may be affected such that you ll be unable to recover from hitting a rock or even just a gust of wind i greatly enjoy social drinking but for me it just doesn t mix with riding max enjoyment eric
