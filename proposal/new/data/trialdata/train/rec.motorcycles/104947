 from edw boi hp com edward walsh subject guzzi eight five zero t tires plus fairing question organization hewlett packard boise idaho x newsreader tin one one pl four lines five nine i have a question about tires for my guzzi it is a seven five eight five zero t the tires that were on it when i just bought it are old and cracked i do not have an owners manual for it yet but the tires listed in the haynes manual are front three five zero h one eight rear four one zero h one eight and pressures recommended are two six front and three three rear oddly the pressure for the same tire on the t three is listed at two nine psi instead anyone know the reason as i know though the pressure i should run at is that recommended by the manufacturer of the new tires i purchase the real question i have is this the old tires that are on the bike are for the front a metzler touring special four one zero h one eight and for the rear an avon roadrunner four seven zero h one eight one two zero nine zero h one eight as marked on each tire both are larger than that listed in the haynes manual what does the owners manual recommend and was it common to go up one size for this bike also this will be my first motorcycle with innertubes any comments on the various manufacturers inner tube qualities the above sizes are inches except for the additional mark on the current rear tire what is the best metric match the local bmw dealer thought one zero zero nine zero h one eight on the front and one two zero nine zero h one eight on the back he also happens to be very good at getting close to matching mail order prices i am thinking of going with a metzler me three three laser possibly comp k on the front and me eight eight on the back both in mbs variety if possible the longer lasting belting system i already use the me three three on both the vision and fj for the front and like it and i thought that with the shaft drive behavior and torque from the guzzi that the me eight eight might give more predictable back end control and sliding behavior than a me five five might as well as giving much better tire milage life any comments a friend told me he thought that my bike had boranni rims which are very good but are relatively soft and have delicate sidewalls i do not wish to mount the tires myself this first time so aside from warning the shop to be careful any other comments i should make i havn t looked at the rim to check out the make yet if it is marked he just told me late yesterday and i havn t had a chance to check the rim type on another note i will remove the ugly but in good shape anyone want it vetter fairing and i will run without a windscreen for a while but eventually i would like a simple rounded cafe style quarter fairing for it it could be fork handlebar mounted any suggestions is there such a thing as a frame mounted quarter fairing of the cafe style for this bike how about lower bars clip ons for it i would like to restore the bike into a good condition runner with a few modern updates but while not being historically exactly accurate still have it reflect relatively well a representation of the cafe style yes i know to be picky that period really predates this bike it is just that this bike has such potential for that look edward walsh hewlett packard company edw boi hp com disk memory division ms four seven five two zero eight three two three two one seven four p o box one five boise idaho eight three seven zero seven eight nine fj one two zero zero eight two xz five five zero rj vision seven five guzzi eight five zero t dod nine eight edward walsh hewlett packard company edw boi hp com disk memory division ms four seven five two zero eight three nine six two one seven four p o box one five boise idaho eight three seven zero seven eight nine fj one two zero zero eight two xz five five zero rj vision seven five guzzi eight five zero t dod nine eight
