 from scs eight cunixb cc columbia edu sebastian c sears subject re need advice for riding with someone on pillion keywords advice pillion help nntp posting host cunixb cc columbia edu reply to scs eight cunixb cc columbia edu sebastian c sears organization columbia university distribution na lines four four in article rwert well sf ca us bob wert writes this person is of a problem but what sort of of advice should i give her before we go i want her to hold onto me rather than the grab rail out back and i ve heard that she should look over my shoulder in the direction we re turning so she leans with me but what else are there traditional signals for slow down or go faster or i hafta go pee etc i ve never liked my passengers to try and shift their weight with the turns at all i find the weight shift can be very sudden and unnerving it s one thing if they re just getting comfortable or decide to look over your other shoulder but i don t recommend having him her shift her weight with each turn too violent also i think someone already said this make sure your passenger wears good gear i sometimes choose to ride without a helmet or lacking other safety gear depends on how squidly i feel but i won t let passengers do it what i do to myself i can handle but i wouldn t want to hurt anyone else so i don t let them on without gloves jacket at least jeans heavy boots and a helmet that fits i really want this to be a positive experience for us both mainly so that she ll want to go with me again so any help will be appreciated go real easy it s amazing how solid a grip you have on the handle bars that your passenger does not don t make her feel like she s going to slide off the back and snappy turns for you are sickening lurches for her in general it feels much less controlled and smooth as a passenger i can t stand being on the back of my brother s bike and i ride aggressively when i ride and i know he s a good pilot still everything feels very unsteady when you re a passenger thanks bob show off by not showing off the first time out this is where i wanna sit and buy you a drink someday temple of the dog sea bass sears scs eight cunixb cc columbia edu dod five one six stanley id seven nine yamaha xs seven five zero f seven seven bmw r one zero zero s eight five toyota four runner nyc ny
