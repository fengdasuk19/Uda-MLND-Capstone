 from jbrown batman bmd trw com subject re origins of the bible lines five six in article eczcaw mips nott ac uk a wainwright writes hi i have been having an argument about the origins of the bible lately with a theist acquaintance he stated that thousands of bibles were discovered at a certain point in time which were syllable perfect this therefore meant that there must have been one copy at a certain time the time quoted by my acquaintace was approximately five zero years after the death of jesus hi adda most bible scholars agree that there was one copy of each book at a certain time the time when the author wrote it unfortunately like all works from this time period and earlier all that exists today are copies cutting all of the crap out of the way ie god wrote it could anyone answer the following one how old is the oldest surviving copy of the new testament there are parts of books scraps really that date from around the mid second century a d one three zero there are some complete books letters etc from the middle third century the first complete collection of the new testament dates from the early four th century a d three two five throughout this period are writings of various early church fathers leaders who quoted various scriptures in their writings two is there any truth in my acquaintance s statements if you mean that someone discovered thousands of bibles which were all perfect copies dating from the last part of the one st century no if you mean that there are thousands of early manuscripts within the dates given above but not letter perfect and that the most probable text can be reconstructed from these documents and that the earliest original autographs now lost probably were written starting sometime shortly after a d five zero then yes three from who where did the bible originate from the original authors we call them matthew mark luke john peter paul james and one other not identified four how long is a piece of string as long as you make it adda regards jim b
