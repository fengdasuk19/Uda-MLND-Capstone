 from davidr rincon ema rockwell com david j ray subject re fractals what good are they organization rockwell international x newsreader tin one one pl five lines one six in regards to fractal commpression i have seen two fractal compressed movies they were both fairly impressive the first one was a six four gray scale movie of casablanca it was one three mb and had one one minutes of one three fps video it was a little grainy but not bad at all the second one i saw was only three minutes but it had eight bit color with one zero fps and measured in at one two mb i consider the fractal movies a practical thing to explore but unlike many other formats out there you do end up losing resolution i don t know what kind of software hardware was used for creating the movies i saw but the guy that showed them to me said it took five one five minutes per frame to generate but as i said above playback was one zero or more frames per second and how else could you put one one minutes on one floppy disk davidr rincon ema rockwell com my opinions are my own except where they are shared by others in which case i will probably change my mind
