 from rytg seven fel tno nl q van rijt subject re sphere from four points organization tno physics and electronics laboratory lines two six there is another useful method based on least sqyares estimation of the sphere equation parameters the points x y z on a spherical surface with radius r and center a b c can be written as x a two y b two z c two r two this equation can be rewritten into the following form two ax two by two cz r two a two b two c two x two y two z two approximate the left hand part by f x y z p one x p two x p three z p four one for all datapoints i c four determine the four parameters p one p four which minimise the average error f x y z x two y two z two two in numerical recipes in c can be found algorithms to solve these parameters the best fitting sphere will have center a b c p one two p two two p three two radius r sqrt p four a a b b c c so at last will this solve you sphere estination problem at least for the most situations i think quick van rijt rytg seven fel tno nl
