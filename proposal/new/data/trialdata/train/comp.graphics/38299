 from weber sipi usc edu allan g weber subject need help with mitsubishi p seven eight u image printer organization university of southern california los angeles ca lines two six distribution na nntp posting host sipi usc edu our group recently bought a mitsubishi p seven eight u video printer and i could use some help with it we bought this thing because it one has a parallel data input in addition to the usual video signal inputs and two claimed to print two five six gray level images however the manual that came with it only describes how to format the parallel data to print one and four bit pixel images after some initial problems with the parallel interface i now have this thing running from a parallel port of an hewlett packard workstation and i can print one and four bit pixel images just fine i called the mitsubishi people and asked about the two five six level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video signal inputs this was not mentioned in the sales literature however they did say the p seven eight u can do six bit pixel six four level images in parallel mode but they didn t have any information about how to program it to do so and they would call japan etc frankly i find it hard to believe that if this thing can do eight bit pixel images from the video source it can t store eight bits pixel in the memory it s not like memory is that expensive any more if anybody has any information on getting six bit pixel or even eight bit pixel images out of this thing i would greatly appreciate your sending it to me thanks allan weber signal image processing institute university of southern california weber sipi usc edu
