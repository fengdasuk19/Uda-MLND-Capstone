 from egg dstos three dsto gov au subject chosing optimal colors for colormap organization defence science and technology organisation lines one two nntp posting host dstos three dsto gov au hi i m looking for an algorithm that would generate a good cross section of rgb colours given a limited colour map size the problem i m writing an application for the pc that may have at most two five six colors i want to use one colormap palette for the application but i d like it to contain an even spread of colours of the visible spectrum i could use a six x six x six rgb cube but the problem is that a lot of those colours are almost identical to the human eye does anyone know how i can optimize my choice of colors
