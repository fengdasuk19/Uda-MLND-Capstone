 from pinky tamu edu the man behind the curtain subject views on isomorphic perspectives organization texas a i m sure that other readers have tried this before and have perhaps formulated their own opinions one the routines for drawing walls one two were trivial but when i ran a packed planar image through them i was dismayed by the jaggies i m now considered some anti aliasing routines speed is not really necessary is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed thus being assured of nice image or is this too much of a burden two wall three presents a problem the algorithm i used tends to overly distort the original i tried to decide on paper what pixels go where and failed has anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared shape currently i take one two three four five six seven eight nine one zero one one one two one three one four one five one six one seven one eight one nine two zero two one two two two three two four two five two six two seven two eight two nine three zero three one three two three three three four three five three six three seven three eight three nine four zero four one four two four three four four four five four six four seven four eight four nine five zero five one five two five three five four five five five six five seven five eight five nine six zero six one six two six three six four and produce one two three four three three three four three five three six one seven one eight one nine two zero five six seven eight four nine five zero five one five two three seven three eight three nine four zero two one two two two three two four nine one zero one one one two five three five four five five five six four one four two four three four four two five two six two seven two eight one three one four one five one six five seven five eight five nine six zero four five four six four seven four eight two nine three zero three one three two six one six two six three six four line one follows the slope line two is directly under line one line three moves up a line and left four pixels line four is under line three this fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels but it causes distortions has anyone come up with a better way perhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap already skewed are there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective i was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z buffering locations are stored in x y z form for those of you who noticed the top lines of wall two and wall one are parallel with its bottom lines this is why there appears to be an optical illusion ie it appears to be either the inside or outside of a cube depending on your mood there are no vanishing points this simplifies the drawing code for objects which don t have to change size as they move about in the room i ve decided that this approximation is alright since small displacements at a large enough distance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in a real perspective drawing hopefully the context of the picture ie chairs on the floor torches hanging on the walls will dispell any visual ambiguity thanks in advance for any help till next time o o v o v email pinky tamu edu sam inala v
