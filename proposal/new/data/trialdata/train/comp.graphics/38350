 organization stanford linear accelerator center from subject re sphere from four points distribution world lines two one from bolson carson u washington edu edward bolson given four points non coplanar how does one find the sphere that is cnter and radius exactly fitting those points the equation of the sphere through the four points x one y one z one x four y four z four is x two y two z two x one two y one two z one two x four two y four two z four two x x one x four y y one y four zero z z one z four one one one when this five by five determininant is expanded on its first column you get the equation in the form a x two y two z two bx cy dz e zero if you need the center and radius jyst divide through by a it cannot be zero if the four given points form a non degenerate tetrahedron and complete the square on x y and z to obtain x xc two y yc two z zc two r two rcb slacvm slac stanford edu bob beach
