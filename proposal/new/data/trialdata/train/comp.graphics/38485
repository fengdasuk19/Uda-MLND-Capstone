 from rgc three six seven nine bcstec ca boeing com robert g carpenter subject re please recommend three d graphics library for mac organization boeing lines three five in article brentb tamsun tamu edu brent writes tsa cellar org the silent assassin writes rgc three six seven nine bcstec ca boeing com robert g carpenter writes can you please offer some recommendations it s really not that hard to do there are books out there which explain everything and the basic three d functions translation rotation shading and hidden line removal are pretty easy i wrote a program in a few weeks witht he help of a book and would be happy to give you my source i think he wanted to avoid reinventing the wheel yes i want to concentrate on other development issues i ve created graphics libraries before it s too time consuming life s too short also quickdraw has a lot of three d functions built in and think pascal can access them and i would expect that think c could as well if you can find out how to use the quickdraw graphics library it would be an excellent choice since it has a lot of stuff and is built into the mac so should be fast just to clarify the three d routines that are mentioned in various places on the mac are in a libray not the rom of the mac a few years ago before i knew anything about implementing graphics i came across a demo of the apple grafsys three d library and it actually did a lot however it is quite limited in the sense that it s a low level three d library your code still has to plot individual points draw each line etc ad nauseum it has nothing on gl for example where you can handle objects thanks for the clarification before posting my original request i had looked into the mac s three d capabilities and dismissed them as low grade bobc
