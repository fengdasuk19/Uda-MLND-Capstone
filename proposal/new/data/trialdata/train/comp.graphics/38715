 from squeegee world std com stephen c gilardi subject need postscript strokeadjust info summary seeking algorithm for endpoint snapping keywords postscript emulation adjust stroke strokeadjust organization sq software via the world public access unix brookline ma lines three one i need information on the display postscript strokeadjust feature this feature adjusts the endpoints of lines so that the displayed line looks better on low resolution devices the postscript literature explains the process to some extent they also give an example of how to emulate strokeadjust in postscript environments where it is absent the suggested emulation is to modify the coordinates of the endpoints of a line using the following formula for each coordinate new coord round old coord zero two five zero two five doing this we end up with all coordinates ending in two five from reading i thought that what they might actually do is new coord trunc old coord two two zero two five this results in all the coordinates ending in either zero two five or zero seven five whichever is closer by doing some actual comparisons with display postscript i find that neither of these is what dps really uses since i like how the dps result looks better than how my stuff looks i d like to know if anyone who knows how dps does it is willing able to tell me thanks steve squeegee world std com
