 from wijkstra fwi uva nl marcel wijkstra aio subject re bw hardcopy of colored window keywords color hardcopy print nntp posting host ic fwi uva nl organization fwi university of amsterdam lines three eight mars ixos de martin stein writes i use xwd xpr from the x one one r five dist and various programs of the ppm tools to print hardcopies of colored x windows my problem is i don t like xpr it gives at least the x one one r four version does louzy output the hardcopy looks very grainy to me instead i use pnmtops this takes full advantage postscript and lets the printer do the dirty job of dithering a graylevel image to black and white dots so if you have a postscript printer try xwdtopnm convert to ppm ppmtopgm to graylevel for smaller file to print pnmtops noturn to postscript lpr print pnmtops has several neat options but use them with care if you want your image to be four wide use pnmtops noturn scale one zero zero width four noturn prevents the image from being rotated if it is wider than it is high width four specifies the paper width not the image width see below scale one zero zero is used because if the image is small it may fit within a width less than four and will thus be printed smaller than four wide if you first scale it up a lot it will certainly not fit in four and will be scaled down by pnmtops automatically to fit the specified paper width in short pnmtops will scale an image down to fit the paper size but it will not blow it up automatically hope this helps marcel x marcel wijkstra aio wijkstra fwi uva nl x faculty of mathematics and computer science x university of amsterdam the netherlands life stinks fortunately i ve got a cold
