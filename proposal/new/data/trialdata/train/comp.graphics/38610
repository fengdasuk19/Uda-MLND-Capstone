 from fox graphics cs nyu edu david fox subject re newsgroup split in reply to tdawson engin umich edu s message of one nine apr one nine nine three one nine four three five two gmt nntp posting host graphics cs nyu edu organization courant institute of mathematical sciences lines one six concerning the proposed newsgroup split i personally am not in favor of doing this i learn an awful lot about all aspects of graphics by reading this group from code to hardware to algorithms i just think making five different groups out of this is a wate and will only result in a few posts a week per group i kind of like the convenience of having one big forum for discussing all aspects of graphics anyone else feel this way just curious i disagree you could learn the same amount by reading all the split groups and it would make things easier for those of us who are less omnivorous there is no waste in creating news groups its just a bit of shuffling about i have no problem with only a few posts per week per group i spend too much time on this as it is david
