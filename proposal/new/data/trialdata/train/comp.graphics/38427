 from steve hcrlgw steven collins subject sphere from four points organization central research lab hitachi ltd lines two four nntp posting host hcrlgw another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by two sets of three points and intersecting the normals from there this would also define the circle center however small numerical imprecisions would make the lines not intersect supposedly three planes have to intersect in a unique point if they are not parallel having thought about this why don t you project the two lines onto the two d plane formed by the lines do an intersection calculation in the plane in two d where you re guaranteed a unique solution unless they re parallel which won t happen in this case and then use parametric distance along the lines from the circle centres to determine the exact point of interest this bypasses the messy error propogation required to do the calculation in three d hope i haven t put my foot in it again steve steven collins email steve crl hitachi co jp visiting computer graphics researcher phone zero four two three two three one one one one hitachi central research lab tokyo fax zero four two three two seven seven seven four two
