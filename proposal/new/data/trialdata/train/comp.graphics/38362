 from lau auriga rose brandeis edu frankie t k lau subject pc fastest line circle drawing routines help organization brandeis university lines four one hi all in short looking for very fast assembly code for line circle drawing on svga graphics complete i am thinking of a simple but fast molecular graphics program to write on pc or clones ball and stick type reasons programs that i ve seen are far too slow for this purpose platform three eight six four eight six class machine eight zero zero x six zero zero one six or one zero two four x seven two eight one six vga graphics speed is important one six color for non rendering purpose is enough may stay at eight zero zero x six zero zero for speed reason hope the code would be generic enough for different svga cards my own card is based on trident eight nine zero zero c not vesa what i m looking for one fast very fast routines to draw lines circles simple shapes on above mentioned svga resolutions presumably in assembly languagine yes very fast please two related codes to help rotating zooming animating the drawings on screen drawings for beginning would be lines circles mainly think of text else later you know the way molecular graphics rotates zooms a molecule two and any other codes preferentially in c that can help the project final remarks non profit expected to become share free ware any help is appreciated thanks frankie lau tammy harvard edu ps pls also email i may miss reply post
