doing the more specific you are the more likely someone will spot an error in what you are doing without all the details people who want to help you often have to guess if they are able to respond at all always mention what version of x you are using and where you got it from if your server came from a different source as the rest of your x system give details of that too give the machine type operating system and o s version for both the client and server machine it may also be appropriate to mention the window manager compiler and display hardware type you are using then tell exactly what

january of one nine eight eight to further the development of the x window system and has as its major goal the promotion of cooperation within the computer industry in the creation of standard software interfaces at all layers in the x window system environment mit s role is to provide the vendor neutral architectural and administrative leadership required to make this work membership in the consortium open to any organization there are two categories of membership member for large organizations and affiliate for smaller organizations most of the consortium s activities take place via electronic mail with meetings when required as designs and specifications take shape interest groups are formed from experts in the participating organizations typically a small multi organization architecture team leads the design with others acting as close observers and reviewers once a complete specification is produced it may be submitted for formal technical review by the consortium as a proposed standard the standards process typically includes public review outside the consortium and a demonstration of proof of concept your involvement in the public review process or as a member or affiliate of the consortium is welcomed write to bob scheifler mit x consortium laboratory for computer science five four five technology square cambridge ma zero two one three nine for complete

motif are two graphical user interfaces guis open look was developed by sun with help from at motif was developed by the open software foundation osf with input from many osf members open look is primarily a user interface specification and style guide there are several toolkits which can be used to produce open look applications motif includes an api specification the only sanctioned motif toolkit is the one from osf however there are other toolkits which can be used to produce programs which look and behave like osf motif one of these parcplace s formerly solbourne s oi is a virtual toolkit which provides objects in the style of open look and motif at the user s choice open look gui is also the name of a product from at a user interface specification open look and a series of

that simplifies the creation and manipulation of three d graphics many platforms are capable of performing in hardware the computations involved in rendering three d objects the extension allows the client phigs in this case to take advantage of the specialized hardware for three d graphics sun microsystems is currently contracted to develop a freely redistributable copyright similar to the current x copyright sample implementation source and documentation are available in the r five release several vendors are currently selling independently developed pex servers for their workstations and x terminals last modified one zero nine one subject one six what is low bandwidth x lbx xremote ppp slip cslip there are several options for using x over serial lines slip serial line ip this is both a mechanism and a protocol for sending ip packets over point to point serial links it has been around for several years and implementations are available for many of the major tcp ip implementations most x terminal vendors supply this as a checkoff item although nobody really ever uses it since it is horribly slow the tcp ip headers add four zero bytes per packet and the tcp ip encoding of the x protocol is rather verbose rightfully so it is optimized for packing and unpacking over high speed links cslip compressed header slip this is a variant of slip that compresses the four zero bytes of tcp ip headers down to about five or six bytes it still doesn t do anything about reencoding the x protocol modems that do compression can help but they increase packet latency it takes time to dribble the uncompressed data through typical serial interfaces plus the compression assembly time ppp point to point protocol this is an emerging standard for point to point links over serial lines that has a more complete set of option negotiation than slip a growing number of people see the combination of ppp for the serial line management and cslip for the header compression as becoming common for running normal tcp ip protocols over serial lines running raw x over the wire still needs compression somewhere to make it usable xremote this is the name of both a protocol and set of products originally developed by ncd for squeezing the x protocol over serial lines in addition to using a low level transport mechanism similar to ppp cslip xremote removes redundancies in the x protocol by sending deltas against previous packets and using lzw to compress the entire data stream this work is done by either a pseudo x server or proxy running on the host or in a terminal server there are several advantages to doing compression outside the modem one you don t have to have compressing modems in there if you wouldn t otherwise be using them e g if you were going to be directly connected and two it reduces the i o overhead by cutting down on the number of bytes that have to cross the serial interface and three in addition to the effects of two it reduces the latency in delivering packets by not requiring the modem to buffer up the data waiting for blocks to compress lbx low bandwidth x this is an x consortium project that is working on a standard for this area it is being chaired by ncd and xerox and is using ncd s xremote protocol as a stepping stone in developing the new protocol lbx will go beyond xremote by adding proxy caching of commonly used information e g connection setup data large window properties font metrics keymaps etc and a more efficient encoding of the x protocol the hope is to have a standard ready for public review in the first half of next year and a sample implementation available in r six additional technical information about how xremote works and a few notes on how lbx might be different are available via anonymous ftp from export lcs mit edu in contrib in the following files xremote slides ps slides describing xremote xremote lbx diffs ps more slides describing some of lbx information provided by jim fulton jim ncd com seven nine two there is also a set of slides on export from jim fulton s talk at the seven th mit x technical conference subject one seven topic using x in day to day life subject one eight what are all these different window managers the window manager in x is just another client it is not part of the x window system although it enjoys special privileges and so there is no single window manager instead there are many which support different ways for the user to interact with windows and different styles of window layout decoration and keyboard and colormap focus in approximate chronological order generally the more recent ones are more conformant with the icccm wm this simple title bar window manager was phased out in r two or r three uwm the universal window manager is still popular for its speed although it is very outdated moved to contrib on the r four tape twm old tom s window manager was among the first non mit window managers and offered the user a great deal of customization options in a re parenting window manager awm the ardent window manager remains a hotbed for hackers and offers some features dynamic menus not found on more current window managers cwm cwm is part of the andrew system rtl siemen s window manager tiles windows so that they don t overlap and resizes the window with the focus to its preferred size dxwm digital s dxwm is part of the decwindows offering hpwm hp s window manager offers a three d look it is a precursor of mwm mwm the motif window manager is part of the osf motif toolkit tekwm tektronix s window manager offering olwm sun olwm implements the open look gui and some of the style guide functionality olwm at one seven n is on avahi inria fr and export lcs mit edu three nine three m swm the sigma window manager is on the r four tape pswm sun s postscript based pswm is part of the openwindows release swm solbourne s swm is based on the oi toolkit and offers multiple gui support and also a panned virtual window configuration information comes from the resources file twm new mit s new tab window manager from the r four tape is a reworked twm and is the basis for several derivatives including the one on the r five tape vtwm vtwm offers some of the virtual desktop features of swm with a single root window implementation it is based on the r four twm and is available on archive servers a new version vtwm five zero is based on r five nine and is available from export three nine two tvtwm tom s virtual tab window manager is also based on the r four twm and provides a virtual desktop modeled on the virtual root window of swm it is available on archive servers olvwm the vtwm style virtual desktop added to sun s olwm it is available on archive servers version three three one nine three is on export mvwm the vtwm style virtual desktop added to osf s mwm a beta version is floating around most recently from suresh unipalm co uk but requires a source license to osf motif one one three three nine two ncdwm the window manager local to ncd terminals offers an mwm look xdswm the window manager local to visual technology s terminals ctwm claude lecommandeur s lecom sic epfl ch modification of the r five twm offers

offers configurable workspaces four dwm sgi s enhanced mwm piewm this version of tvtwm offers pie menus subject one nine why does my x session exit when i kill my window manager sic it needn t what is probably happening is that you are running your window manager as the last job in your xsession or xinitrc file your x session runs only as long as the last job is running and so killing your window manager is equivalent to logging out instead run the window manager in the background and as the last job instead invoke something safe like exec xterm name login rv iconic or any special client of your devising which exits on some user action your x session will continue until you explicitly logout of this window whether or not you kill or restart your window manager subject two zero can i save the state of my x session like toolplaces does although no known window manager directly supports such a feature which may be equivalent to writing out a xinitrc or xsession file naming the geometry and wm command of each application but olvwm may have something close there is a contributed application which does much of what you are looking for although it is not as complete as the sunview program toolplaces look for the application xplaces on an archive server near you there are several versions of this program floating around look for a recent vintage one zero nine zero some new pseudo session managers such as hp s vuewm provide for the saving of sessions including information on the geometry of currently running applications and the resource database bjxrn stabell bjoerns staff cs uit no three nine three subject two one how do i use another window manager with dec s session manager dec s session manager will start dxwm up by default to override this add to your xdefaults file something like this line naming the full pathname sm windowmanagername wherever usr bin x one one your favorite wm subject two two how do i change the keyboard auto repeat rate you can turn auto repeat on or off by using xset r on off the x protocol however doesn t provide for varying the auto repeat rate which is a capability not supported by all systems some servers running on systems that support this however may provide command line flags to set the rate at start up time if you have control over server start up see the man pages for xinit and xdm you can invoke the server with the chosen settings for example you can start the xsun server from mit with the options ar one three five zero ar two three zero to reduce the sensitivity of the keyboard subject two three how do i remap the keys on my keyboard to produce a string there is no method of arranging for a particular string to be produced when you press a particular key the xmodmap client which is useful for moving your ctrl and esc keys to useful places just rearranges keys and does not do macro expansion some few clients including xterm and several x based editors accept a translation resource such as xterm vt one zero zero translations override f one string setenv display unix zero which permits the shorthand f one to be pressed to reset the display locally within an xterm it takes effect for new xterm clients to include control characters in the string use nnn where nnn is the octal encoding of the control character you want to include window managers which could provide this facility do not yet nor has a special remapper client been made available david b lewis faq craft uunet uu net just the faqs ma am joe friday david b lewis temporarily at but not speaking for visual inc day dbl visual
