guidelines should be viewed as hints and suggestions x entries that violate the guidelines but remain within the rules are x allowed even so you are safer if you remain within the guidelines x x you should read the current ioccc rules prior to submitting entries x the rules are typically sent out with these guidelines x x changes from the one nine nine three draft are noted by change bars x x xwhat is new in one nine nine three x x the entry format is better for us anyway the program mkentry c x has been updated see entry format x x we will reject entries that cannot be compiled using an ansi c x compiler certain old obfuscation hacks that cause ansi c compilers x fits are no longer permitted some of the new issues deal with x non integral array types variable number of arguments c preprocessor x directives and the exit function see our likes and dislikes x x xhints and suggestions x x you are encouraged to examine the winners of previous contests see x for more information for details on how to get previous winners x x keep in mind that rules change from year to year so some winning entries x may not be valid entries this year what was unique and novel one year x might be old the next year x x an entry is usually examined in a number of ways we typically apply x a number of tests to an entry x x look at the original source x convert ansi tri graphs to ascii x c pre process the source ignoring include lines x c pre process the source ignoring define and include lines x run it through a c beautifier x examine the algorithm x lint it x compile it x execute it x x you should consider how your entry looks in each of the above tests x you should ask yourself if your entry remains obscure after it has been x cleaned up by the c pre processor and a c beautifier x x your entry need not do well under all or in most tests in certain x cases a test is not important entries that compete for the x strangest most creative source layout need not do as well as x others in terms of their algorithm on the other hand given x two such entries we are more inclined to pick the entry that x does something interesting when you run it x x we try to avoid limiting creativity in our rules as such we leave x the contest open for creative rule interpretation as in real life x programming interpreting a requirements document or a customer request x is important for this reason we often award worst abuse of the x rules to an entry that illustrates this point in an ironic way x x if you do plan to abuse the rules we suggest that you let us know x in the remarks section please note that an invitation to abuse x is not an invitation to break we are strict when it comes to the x three two one seven byte size limit also abusing the entry format tends to x annoy more than amuse x x we do realize that there are holes in the rules and invite entries x to attempt to exploit them we will award worst abuse of the rules x and then plug the hole next year even so we will attempt to use x the smallest plug needed if not smaller x x check out your program and be sure that it works we sometimes make x the effort to debug an entry that has a slight problem particularly x in or near the final round on the other hand we have seen some x of the best entries fall down because they didn t work x x we tend to look down on a prime number printer that claims that x one six is a prime number if you do have a bug you are better off x documenting it noting this entry sometimes prints the four th power x of a prime by mistake would save the above entry and sometimes x a strange bug feature can even help the entry of course a correctly x working entry is best x x xour likes and dislikes x x doing masses of defines to obscure the source has become old we x tend to see thru masses of defines due to our pre processor tests x that we apply simply abusing defines or dfoo bar won t go as far x as a program that is more well rounded in confusion x x many ansi c compilers dislike the following code and so do we x x define d define x d foo don t expect this to turn into define foo x x int i x j don t use such implicit type declaration x int k x x we suggest that you compile your entry with an ansi c compiler if you x must use non ansi c such as k x char c x ic use ci instead x i three string use string i three instead x x if your entry uses functions that have a variable number of x arguments be careful systems implement va list as a wide variety x of ways because of this a number of operations using va list are x not portable and must not be used x x assigning a non va list variable to from a va list variable x casting a non va list variable into from a va list variable x passing a va list variable to a function expecting a non va list arg x passing a non va list variable to a function expecting a va list arg x performing arithmetic on va list variables x using va list as a structure or union x x in particular do not treat va list variables as if they were a char s x x avoid using use instead x x if you use c preprocessor directives define if ifdef x the leading must be the first character on a line while some x c preprocessors allow whitespace the leading many do not x x because the exit function returns void on some systems entries x must not assume that it returns an int x x small programs are best when they are short obscure and concise x while such programs are not as complex as other winners they do x serve a useful purpose they are often the only program that people x attempt to completely understand for this reason we look for x programs that are compact and are instructional x x one line programs should be short one line programs say around eight zero x bytes long getting close to one six zero bytes is a bit too long in our opinion x x we tend to dislike programs that x x are very hardware specific x are very os or un x version specific x index strchr differences are ok but socket streams specific x code is likely not to be x dump core or have compiler warnings x it is ok only if you warn us in the remark header item x won t compile under both bsd or sys v un x x abusing the build file to get around the size limit x obfuscate by excessive use of ansi tri graphs x are longer than they need to be x are similar to previous winners x are identical to previous losers x x unless you are cramped for space or unless you are entering the x best one liner category we suggest that you format your program x in a more creative way than simply forming excessively long lines x x the build file should not be used to try and get around the size x limit it is one thing to make use of a several d s to help out x but it is quite another to use two zero zero bytes of d s in order to x try and squeeze the source under the size limit you should feel x free to make use of the build file space but you are better off x if you show some amount of restraint x x we allowed whitespace and in certain cases do not impact x your program size up to a certain point because we want to get x away from source that is simply a compact blob of characters x x given two versions of the same program one that is a compact blob x of code and the other that is formatted more like a typical c x program we tend to favor the second version of course a third x version of the same program that is formatted in an interesting x and or obfuscated way would definitely win over the first two x x we suggest that you avoid trying for the smallest self replicating x program we are amazed at the many different sizes that claim x to be the smallest there is nothing wrong with self replicating x programs in fact a number of winners have been self replicating x you might want to avoid the claim of smallest lest we or others x know of a smaller one x x x client entries should be as portable as possible entries that x adapt to a wide collection of environments will be favored don t x depend on a particular type of display for example don t depend x on color or a given size don t require backing store x x x client entries should avoid using x related libraries and x software that is not in wide spread use we ask that such x client x entries restrict themselves to only the low level xlib and the x athena widget set libx one one a libxaw a libxmu a and libxt a x don t use m tif xv ew or openl ok toolkits since not everyone x has them avoid depending on a particular window manager not x everyone has x one one r five and some people are stuck back in x one one r four or x earlier so try to target x one one r five without requiring x one one r five better x yet try to make your entry run on all version one one x window systems x x x client entries should not to depend on particular items on x xdefaults if you must do so be sure to note the required lines x in the remark section x x we like programs that x x are as concise and small as they need to be x do something at least quasi interesting x pass lint without complaint not a requirement but it is nice x are portable x are unique or novel in their obfuscation style x make use of a number of different types of obfuscation x make us laugh and or throw up x x some types of programs can t excel in some areas of course your x program doesn t have to excel in all areas but doing well in several x areas really does help x x we freely admit that interesting creative or humorous comments in x the remark section helps your chance of winning if you had to x read of many twisted entries you too would enjoy a good laugh or two x we think the readers of the contest winners do as well x x be creative x x xentry format x x in order to help us process the many entries we must request your x assistance by formatting your entries in a certain way this format x in addition allows us to quickly separate information about the x author from the program itself see judging process x x we have provided the program mkentry as an example of how to x format entries you should be aware of the following warning that x is found in mkentry c x x this program attempts to implement the ioccc rules every x attempt has been made to make sure that this program produces x an entry that conforms to the contest rules in all cases x where this program differs from the contest rules the x contest rules will be used be sure to check with the x contest rules before submitting an entry x x you are not required to use mkentry it is convenient however x as it attempts to uuencode the needed files and attempt to check x the entry against the size rules x x if you have any suggestions comments fixes or complaints about x the mkentry c program please send email to the judges see below x x the following is a sample entry x x

that we will use the entry title send us a version of x your build program files that uses the name convention you x should uuencode these files in data sections x x if your entry needs to modify its source info or binary files x please say so in the remark section you should try to avoid x touching your original build source and binary files you should x arrange to make copies of the files you intend to modify this x will allow people to re generate your entry from scratch x x remember that your entry may be built without a build file we x typically incorporate the build lines into a makefile if the x build file must exist say so in the remark section x x if your entry needs special info files you should uuencode them x into info sections in the case of multiple info files x use multiple info sections if no info files are needed x then skip the info section x x info files are intended to be input or detailed information that x does not fit well into the remark section for example an x entry that implements a compiler might want to provide some sample x programs for the user to compile an entry might want to include a x lengthy design document that might not be appropriate for a x hints file x x info files should be used only to supplement your entry for x example info files may provide sample input or detailed x information about your entry because they are supplemental x the entry should not require them exist x x in some cases your info files might be renamed to avoid name x conflicts if info files should not be renamed for some reason x say so in the remark section x x info files must uudecode into the current directory if they x absolutely must be renamed or moved into a sub directory say x so in the remark section x x when submitting multiple entries be sure that each entry has x a unique entry number from zero to seven your first entry should x have entry number zero x x with the exception of the header all text outside of the entry x format may be ignored that is don t place text outside of the x entry and expect the judges to see it our decoding tools aren t x ai progs if you need tell the the something put it in the x remark section or send a email to the judges at x x hoptoad judges not the address for x judges toad com submitting entries x x the date should be given with respect to utc some systems refer x to this as gmt or gmt zero the format of the date should be that as x returned by asctime in the c locale an example of such a string is x x thr apr zero one zero zero four seven zero zero one nine nine three x x this format is similar to the output of the date one command the x string does not include the timezone name before the year on many x systems one of the following command will produce a similar

sure that the resubmittion uses the same title and entry number x as well as these are used to determine which entry is to be x replaced x x xjudging process x x entries are judged by larry bassel and landon curt noll x x entries are unpacked into individual directories the email message x is unpacked into individual files each containing x x entry section x all author sections x all info sections x build section x program section x any other text including the email message headers x x prior to judging the any other text file is scanned to be sure x it does not contain useful information or in case the entry was x malformed and did not unpack correctly information from the x author sections are not read until the judging process is x complete and then only from entries that have won an award x x the above process helps keep us biased for against any one particular x individual we are usually kept in the dark as much as you are x until the final awards are given we like the surprise of finding x out in the end who won and where they were from x x we attempt to keep all entries anonymous unless they win an award x because the main prize of winning is being announced we make all x attempts to send non winners into oblivion we remove all non winning x files and shred all related paper by tradition we do not even x reveal the number of entries that we received for the curious x we do indicate the volume of paper consumed when presenting the ioccc x winners at talks x x after the usenix announcement we attempt to send email to the x authors of the winning entries one reason we do this is to give x the authors a chance to comment on the way we have presented their x entry they are given the chance to correct mistakes typos we x often accept their suggestions comments about our remarks as well x this is done prior to posting the winners to the wide world x x judging consists of a number of elimination rounds during a round x the collection of entries are divided into two roughly equal piles x the pile that advances on to the next round and the pile that does x not we also re examine the entries that were eliminated in the x previous round thus an entry gets at least two readings x x a reading consists of a number of actions x x reading the entry section x reading the uudecoded build section x reading the uudecoded program section x reading the uudecoded info section s if any x passing the source thru the c pre processor x shipping over any include files x performing a number of c beautify cleanup edits on the source x passing the beautified source thru the c pre processor x shipping over any include files x x in later rounds other actions are performed x x linting the source x compiling building the source x running the program x performing misc tests on the source and binary x x until we reduce the stack of entries down to about two five entries entries x are judged on an individual basis an entry is set aside because it x does not in our opinion meet the standard established by the round x when the number of entries thins to about two five entries we begin to form x award categories entries begin to compete with each other for awards x an entry often will compete in several categories x x the actual award category list will vary depending on the types of entries x we receive a typical category list might be x x best small one line program x best small program x strangest most creative source layout x most useful obfuscated program x best game that is obfuscated x most creatively obfuscated program x most deceptive c code x best x client see our likes and dislikes x best abuse of ansi c x worst abuse of the rules x x x we do not limit ourselves to this list for example a few entries are so x good bad that they are declared winners at the start of the final round x we will invent awards categories for them if necessary x x in the final round process we perform the difficult tasks of x reducing the remaining entries typically about two five down to eight or one zero x winners often we are confident that the entries that make it into x the final round are definitely better than the ones that do not x make it the selection of the winners out of the final round is x less clear cut x x sometimes a final round entry good enough to win but is beat out x by a similar but slightly better entry for this reason it is x sometimes worthwhile to re enter an improved version of an entry x that failed to win in a previous year this assumes of course x that the entry is worth improving in the first place x x more often that not we select a small entry usually one line a x strange creative layout entry and an entry that abuses the contest x rules in some way x x in the end we traditionally pick one entry as best sometimes such x an entry simply far exceeds any of the other entry more often the x best is picked because it does well in a number of categories x x xannouncement of winners x x the first announcement occurs at a summer usenix conference by tradition x this is done during the latter part of the uunet ioccc bof just prior to x the berkeley bsd and bsdi bof x x winning entries will be
