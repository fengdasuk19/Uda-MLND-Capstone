 from skelley umiacs umd edu stephen kelley subject expose configure event handling r four vs r five organization umiacs university of maryland college park md two zero seven four two lines two nine i have two questions well probably more about how expose configure events are handled i have an appl which uses one window to draw in since i give the user the capability of scaling and zooming as well as allowing the window to be resized i made a translation table for the expose configure events the expose event calls my redraw method while the configure event calls my rescale method the rescale method invokes a fake expose event actually just calls the redraw w an appropriate expose struct to draw the data quest one when the appl is compiled linked w r four running in either r four or r five env i get multiple four redraws when the window gets uncovered or the size is changed i assume i m getting cascading events is that right any suggestions as to how to handle trap events in a better way quest two when the appl is compiled linked w r five i get no expose events whatsoever do events and or translation tables act differently in r five thanks in advance steve steve kelley umcp cs umiacs captain i protest internet skelley umiacs umd edu i am not a merry man worf
