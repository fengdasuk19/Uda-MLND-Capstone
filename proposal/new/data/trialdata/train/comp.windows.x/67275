 from martinh cac washington edu martin hunt subject announcing tcpview a motif based tcp ip protocol analyzer organization uw networks and distributed computing lines eight nine keywords protocol analyzer tcp ip to xannounce expo lcs mit edu tcpview is the result of several problems we had at uw we have several network general sniffers which are heavily used to help debug problems on several hundred subnets these are good tools but they are one heavy two hard to find when you need one three limited in their software expandibility four difficult to use to upload data for analysis five cannot be remotely operated and six cannot resolve names with dns requiring much manual manipulation of the name table we also sometimes use tcpdump but we found it one too difficult for most people two did not have enough information for many protocols three could not be used interactively four could not handle tcp streams and five could not read sniffer files however tcpdump did do a reasonable job of decoding a large number of protocols and could be easily modified tcpview is an attempt to resolve these problems by adding a motif interface to tcpdump and expanding its features tcpview has been tested on a decstation five zero zero zero and sun four under ultrix four two and sunos four one respectively it should work on the same systems as tcpdump it compiles with cc and gcc on the dec and sun to build tcpview you will need motif one one or better the following files are available for anonymous ftp from ftp cac washington edu in pub networking tcpview one zero tar z tcpview and tcpdump source code tcpview one zero sun tar z sun four binaries tcpview one zero dec tar z dec mips ultrix four two binaries what tcpview adds to tcpdump easier interface enhanced protocol decoding hex display of frame capture based on time number of frames or user interrupt can show ethernet addresses with manufacturer s name ethernet address host table can easily follow a stream highlighting out of order frames can send tcp data to an external file or filter for additional processing changes to tcpdump two two one new features now reads and writes network general sniffer files when used with r the file type will be automatically detected can now read in and use an snmp mib file the hex format has been changed new time options have been added options were added to allow viewing and processing of the data in tcp packets bugs were fixed in the relative tcp sequence numbers s flag new flags r read sniffer file not usually needed except for reading from stdin ttt prints delta times tttt prints times relative to the first frame w write a sniffer save file use with w x print frame minus link level header in hexdump format sample output one six three six two three three four nine eight five one jeff cac washington edu one two eight five nic funet fi ftp s zero zero zero win one six three eight four zero zero zero zero four five zero zero zero zero two eight eight a nine eight zero zero zero zero three c zero six seven c nine c eight zero five f seven zero zero two e p zero zero one zero eight zero d six zero six six four zero five zero five zero zero one five five b one nine four a zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero d j zero zero two zero five zero zero two four zero zero zero four e one three zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero p n x print tcp data in hexdump format used with z z write tcp data to stdout use with t to eliminate timestamp z write frames and tcp data to stdout martin m hunt martinh cac washington edu networks distributed computing university of washington martin hunt martinh cac washington edu networks and distributed computing university of washington
