 from rps arbortext com ralph seguin subject numlock masking interference with meta compose extendchar organization the internet lines one seven to xpert expo lcs mit edu my question is this is there a means of determining what the state of capslock and or numlock is alright ignore this i have delved a bit deeper xkeyevent and found what i was looking for ev state has a bunch of masks to check against lockmask is the one for capslock unfortunately it appears that the numlock mask varies from server to server how does one tell what mask is numlock and which are for meta mod one mask mod two mask mod three mask mod four mask mod five mask eg sgi s vendor server has mod two mask being numlock whereas solaris one zero one openwindows three zero has mod three mask for numlock is there an unambiguous means of determining numlock s mask at runtime for any given server sorry for the wasted bandwidth and my appalling ignorance thanks ralph
