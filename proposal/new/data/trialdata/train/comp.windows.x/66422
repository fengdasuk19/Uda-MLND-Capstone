one r four sunos four one two patch version three z subject nine seven why can t gcc compile x one one r four on my sparc i used gcc to compile the whole distribution but i get several segmentation faults when running x note first that gcc on risc machines does not necessarily result in any performance increase it certainly is not as noticeable as it is on the six eight zero x zero or vax platforms here is the problem gcc and cc use incompatible methods of passing structures as arguments and returning them as function values so when gcc compiled parts of x are linked with sun supplied functions that pass or return structs run time errors occur affected programs include rgb and the server this is from the gcc manual on the sparc gnu cc uses an incompatible calling convention for structures it passes them by including their contents in the argument list whereas the standard compiler passes them effectively by reference this really ought to be fixed but such calling conventions are not yet supported in gnu cc so it isn t straightforward to fix it the convention for structure returning is also incompatible and fpcc struct return does not help you can duck the problem either by using cc throughout or by using it for just the routines which cause incompatibilities the problem cannot be solved with compilation flags files which need to be compiled using cc include server os four two bsd oscolor c rgb rgb c in addition several of the inet functions use structs as args or return values clients xhost xhost c clients xauth gethost c calls to inet addr in lib clx socket c and lib x xconndis c are possibly harmless as they don t involve structs collected by bashford scripps edu don bashford eight nine zero subject nine eight what are these i o errors running x built with

apparently didn t work you can do this simple test include siocgifconf run that through cc e and gcc e the last line of output is the piece of interest it should be identical modulo irrelevant differences like whitespace if the gcc version has x where the cc version has i your fixincludes run didn t work for some reason or other go back to your gcc sources and run fixincludes then rebuild

libxmu so four not found or even ld so call to undefined procedure gethostname from zero xf seven seven six a nine six c if you are building with shared libraries on a sun remember that you need to run ldconfig as root after installing the shared libraries if you ve installed x on a file server run it on the server s clients too while building and installing the distribution you need to be careful to avoid linking against any existing x shared libraries you might have e g those distributed with openwindows you should make sure you do not have ld library path set in your environment during the build or the installation if you are going to keep xterm and xload as setuid programs please note that the shared libraries must be installed in usr lib usr local lib or usr five lib for these programs to work or else those programs must be linked statically courtesy mit x consortium note also that the program mkfontdir is run as part of the build it attempts however to use the shared libraries before they have been installed you can avoid the errors by building mkfontdir statically pass bstatic to most c compilers subject one zero two can olit programs run with r five xt xtqstring

link with absolute paths to the libraries from rws expo lcs mit edu bob scheifler one two nine zero the r five version of xterm does this automatically by rebuilding xterm against the newly installed

six what is imake imake is not a replacement for the make program instead it is a makefile generator that takes advantages of the include file and macro processing capabilities of the c preprocessor cpp to generate makefiles suitable for building software on a particular system although it is not specific to x the x release uses it to help solve a number of the configuration issues that arise in making such a large system widely portable imake has a fairly steep learning curve in part because the process by which the system specific configuration files system independent configuration files and individual imakefiles are melded to produce a makefile is not obvious there have been several different versions of imake the r three r four and r five versions are different you can obtain information on imake from these sources the r four and r five release notes and imake man page include information on using imake to build x the r four and r five file mit config readme also contains

some third party toolkits redistribute versions of imake along with their own implementations of the template and configuration files there are no real standards for such configuration files although most current contributed software expects the templates distributed with x one one r five export contains the r five distribution unpacked so you can pick up imake without picking up the entire

subject one zero eight i have a program with an imakefile but no makefile what to do if you have r four or r five installed on your system run xmkmf this is a script which runs imake for you with the correct arguments the output is a makefile configured for your system and based on the imakefile then run make which will use that new makefile to compile the program subject one zero nine why can t i link to the xlib shape routines when i try to compile certain programs i get the following link error undefined xshapequeryextension xshapecombinemask these routines are actually part of the shape extension to x shape which was introduced in the mit x one one r four distribution and allows non rectangular windows like the other sample server extensions the shape extension will only run on a server which supports it pre x one one r four servers as well as many vendor supplied servers do not support the shape extension in which case they will display rectangular windows anyway in order to use the shape extension you must link to the library libxext a in the x one one r four distribution this library and the associated includes will be in the mit extensions directory if you do not have these files do not despair many freeware programs which use the shape extension can also be compiled without it by removing the dshape define from the makefile you can probably do this and compile successfully against your older vendor supplied x libraries from john b melby melby yk fujitsu co jp uunet uu net three nine one subject one one zero what are these problems with xtinherit not found on the sun when i run a x program that i wrote on a sunos four zero three or four one machine i get the error ld so symbol not found xtinherit what you are seeing is a side effect of a kludge in the r four libxt a to get sun shared libraries working apparently you can t share a function that is both called and compared as xtinherit is this was handled by putting xtinherit in the same file as a function that is always used thereby guaranteeing that it would be loaded that is in initialize c where xttoolkitinitialize and xtinitialize reside these routines would normally be called you are probably seeing this error because your program is not a normal xt based program and does not call xttoolkitinitialize anywhere one it may be a program that uses xt functions but never opens a connection to the x server osf motif s one one zero uil had this problem it called xtmalloc and other xt functions the solution is to add the call to your program the function does not have to be executed just linked in two alternatively your program doesn t need any xt functions and is correct in not calling xttoolkitinitialize it may be an xlib or xview program in this case you can remove lxt from your link command it should not be necessary to link the shared libraries statically although this will certainly solve the problem from jordan hayes now jordan moorenet com and danny backx db sunbim be one one nine zero subject one one one why can t i compile my r three xaw contrib programs under the new x i have a program that worked well under x one one r three when i try to link it under the current version of x i get this message undefined xtscrollbarsetthumb xttextsetinsertionpoint xttextreplace there were several name changes in the athena widget set in addition to the header files moving into these are mentioned in the r four release notes in this case these functions are not really xt functions but are part of the xaw text widget and so have been renamed from xt to xaw one zero nine zero subject one one two topic programming problems and puzzles subject one one three why doesn t my program get the keystrokes i select for sic the window manager controls how the input focus is transferred from one window to another in order to get keystrokes your program must ask the window manager for the input focus to do this you must set up what are called hints for the window manager if your applications is xlib based you can use something like the following xwmhints wmhints wmhints flags inputhint wmhints input true xsetwmhints dpy window if you don t have source you can start up the application with the resource input true certain window managers notably dxwm and olwm are very picky about having this done if you are using sun s openwindows olwm you can also add this resource to your defaults file to use clients that aren t icccm compliant openwindows focuslenience true mostly courtesy dave lemke of ncd and stuart marks of sun subject one one four how do i figure out what window manager is running you can t reliably tell whatever mechanism you could use could be spoofed in any case for most cases you shouldn t care which window manager is running so long as you do things in an icccm conformant manner there are some cases in which particular window managers are known to do things wrong checking for particular hints placed on the window by the window manager so that you can sidestep the problem may be appropriate in these cases alternatively it may be appropriate to determine which window manager is running in order to take advantage of specific added features such as olwm s push pin menus in order to give your program added functionality beware of usurping the window manager s functions by providing that functionality even when it is missing this surely leads to future compatibility problems subject one one five is there a skeleton x program available there is no general framework such as the transskel program for the macintosh which handles lots of the odds and ends and overhead of development under a window system and which can be used as a platform for additional development in x the problem is typically solved by using an interactive application builder tool or by using cut an updated version of this program which uses r four xlib calls and current icccm conventions was posted in two nine zero to comp windows x by glenn widener of tektronix three nine zero in addition a sample xt program for xaw or xm by rainer klute showing how to open multiple displays and how to catch a broken display connection is available on export lcs mit edu in contrib mdisp tar z four nine two subject one one six why does xtgetvalues not work for me sic the xtgetvalues interface for retrieving resources from a widget is sensitive to the type of variable your code may be doing something like this but xtnsensitive is a boolean which on most machines is a single byte declaring the variable sensitive as boolean works properly this problem comes up often when using particular toolkits that redefine the xt types dimension and position code that assumes they are int will have similar problems if those types are actually short in general you are safe if you use the actual type of the resource as it appears in the widget s man page one one nine zero subject one one seven why don t xtconfigurewidget xtresizewidget xtmovewidget work you re probably trying to use these functions from application code they should be used only internally to widgets these functions are for a parent widget to change the geometry of its children other promising functions xtmakegeometryrequest and xtmakeresizerequest are also for use only by widgets in this case by a child to request a change from its parent the only way for your application to request a geometry change for a widget is to issue an xtsetvalues call setting some of the geometry resources although this will result in the widget internal functions being called your application code must use the standard xtsetvalues interface or risk the widgets data becoming corrupted the xlib calls xmovewindow and xresizewindow should similarly be avoided they shouldn t be used to change xtnx xtny xtnwidth or xtnheight subject one one eight why isn t there an xtreparentwidget call like xreparentwindow although there are various details of the current implementation of the xt internals which make reparenting difficult the major reason that no such call exists is that it remains undefined what the set of resources for the new widget should be resources are typically set based on the location in the instance hierarchy what resources should change if the instance moves what should happen to the widget s children and by the time such semantics are defined there would probably be little advantage over destroying the old widget and creating a new widget in the correct location with the desired resources as setting the resources correctly is the majority of work in creating a new widget note that reparenting is possible in the oi toolkit david b lewis faq craft uunet uu net just the faqs ma am joe friday david b lewis temporarily at but not speaking for visual
