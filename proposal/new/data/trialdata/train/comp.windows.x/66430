widget and a filedialog widget one two nine one five nine two some material from larry carroll larryc poe jpl nasa gov five nine one subject two eight how can i change the titlebar of my xterm window the solution involves sending an escape sequence to xterm which will cause it to update the property which the window manager relies upon for the string which appears in the window titlebar a solution is as easy as typing this in an xterm running a shell echo esc two text g where esc is the escape key text is the string you wish to have displayed and g is a control g the bel character here is a more complicated csh alias which changes the titlebar to the current working directory when you change directories alias newcd cd echo n esc two cwd g the digit two in these strings indicates to xterm that it should change only the title of the window to change both the title and the name used in the icon use the digit zero instead and use one to change only the icon name note another way to do this which prevents an incorrect display of the local directory if a modified cd is used in a subshell is to wrap the escape sequences into the ps one prompt itself note on an ibm rs six zero zero zero is may be necessary to begin the sequence with a v subject two nine where can i find the xterm control sequences the best source of such information is in your r five sources in the file ctlseqs ms a postscript version is in mit hardcopy clients ctlseqs ps z o reilly s volume three the x user s guide includes an r five version of the control sequences the standard volume will be available three nine three and a motif version of the book is available now the current r four guide includes an outdated version of the control sequences one nine three other good sources of information include the r four version of that document and also the file in the r four sources called mit clients xterm ctlseq two txt a compilation put together by skip montanaro ge cr six nine two subject three two why are my xterm menus so small you are probably setting the geometry small accidentally if you give a resource specification like this xterm geometry eight zero x two four then you are asking for all widgets under xterm to have their geometry set to eight zero x two four for the main window this is ok as it uses characters for its size but its popup menus don t they are in pixels and show up small to set only the terminal widget to have the specified geometry name it explicitly xterm vt one zero zero geometry eight zero x two four subject three three how can i print the current selection you could paste it into an xterm after executing the lpr command however a program by richard hesketh rlh two ukc ac uk specifically for manipulating the selection will help e g xselection primary lpr finds the primary selection and prints it this command can be placed in a window manager menu or in shell scripts xselection also permits the setting of the selection and other properties a version is on export also available is ria ccs uwo ca pub xget selection tar z which can be adapted to do this subject three four how does xt use environment variables in loading resources you can use several environment variables to control how resources are loaded for your xt based programs xfilesearchpath xuserfilesearchpath and xapplresdir these environment variables control where xt looks for application defaults files as an application is initializing xt loads at most one app defaults file from the path defined in xfilesearchpath and another from the path defined in xuserfilesearchpath set xfilesearchpath if software is installed on your system in such a way that app defaults files appear in several different directory hierarchies suppose for example that you are running sun s open windows and you also have some r four x applications installed in usr lib x one one app defaults you could set a value like this for xfilesearchpath and it would cause xt to look up app defaults files in both usr lib x one one and usr openwin lib or wherever your openwinhome is located setenv xfilesearchpath usr lib x one one t n openwinhome lib t n the value of this environment variable is a colon separated list of pathnames the pathnames contain replacement characters as follows see xtresolvepathname n the value of the filename parameter or the application s class name t the value of the file type in this case the literal string app defaults c customization resource r five only s suffix none for app defaults l language locale and codeset e g ja jp euc l language part of l e g ja t the territory part of the display s language string c the codeset part of the display s language string let s take apart the example suppose the application s class name is myterm also suppose open windows is installed in usr openwin notice the example omits locale specific lookup usr lib x one one t n means usr lib x one one app defaults myterm openwinhome lib t n means usr openwin lib app defaults myterm as the application initializes xt tries to open both of the above app defaults files in the order shown as soon as it finds one it reads it and uses it and stops looking for others the effect of this path is to search first in usr lib x one one then in usr openwin let s consider another example this time let s set xuserfilesearchpath so it looks for the file myterm ad in the current working directory then for myterm in the directory app defaults setenv xuserfilesearchpath n ad home app defaults n the first path in the list expands to myterm ad the second expands to home app defaults myterm this is a convenient setting for debugging because it follows the imake convention of naming the app defaults file myterm ad in the application s source directory so you can run the application from the directory in which you are working and still have the resources loaded properly note when looking for app default files with xuserfilesearchpath for some bizarre reason neither the type nor file suffix is defined so t and s are useless with r five there s another twist you may specify a customization resource value for example you might run the myterm application like this myterm xrm customization color if one of your pathname specifications had the value usr lib x one one t n c then the expanded pathname would be usr lib x one one app defaults myterm color because the c substitution character takes on the value of the customization resource the default xfilesearchpath compiled into xt is usr lib x one one l t n c r five usr lib x one one l t n c r five usr lib x one one t n c r five usr lib x one one l t n usr lib x one one l t n usr lib x one one t n note some sites replace usr lib x one one with a projectroot in this batch of default settings the default xuserfilesearchpath also compiled into xt is l n c r five l n c r five n c r five l n l n n is either the value of xapplresdir or the user s home directory if xapplresdir is not set if you set xuserfilesearchpath to some value other than the default xt ignores xapplresdir altogether notice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find your app defaults file in your current working directory is to set xapplresdir to a single dot in r three all this machinery worked differently for r three compatibilty many people set their xapplresdir value to a dot followed by a slash thanks to oliver jones oj world std com two nine three subject three five how to i have the r four xdm put a picture behind the log in window the answer lies in changing xdm s xrdb resource in the xdm config file to run a program to change the background before loading the resources for example your usr lib x one one xdm xdm config file may add the line displaymanager zero authorize false to permit unrestricted access to the display before log in beware and also displaymanager xrdb usr lib x one one xdm new xrdb where that file does something for all connections along the lines of bin sh comes in with arguments display zero load usr lib x one one xdm xresources usr bin x one one xsetroot display two bitmap usr lib x one one xdm new bitmap usr bin x one one xrdb substitute xloadimage or xv for xsetroot to taste note that this is a general hack that can be used to invoke a console window or any other client thanks to jay bourland jayb cauchy stanford edu nine nine one subject three six why isn t my path set when xdm runs my xsession file when xdm runs your xsession it doesn t source your cshrc or login files you can set the path explicitly as you normally could for any sh script or you can place all environment setting statements in a separate file and source it from both the xsession file and your shell configuration file or if you set your path in your cshrc file the normal place you can make your xsession have path set simply by making it a csh script i e by starting your xsession file off with bin csh if this doesn t work also try starting off with bin sh reset path path csh c echo path export path subject three seven how do i keep my display when i rlogin to another machine there are several ways to avoid having to do a setenv display whenever you log in to another networked unix machine running x one solution is to use the clients xrsh on the r five contrib tape it includes xrsh a script to start an x application on remote machine and xrlogin a script to start a local xterm running rlogin to a remote machine a more recent version is on export in xrsh five four shar one solution is to use the xrlogin program from der mouse mouse larry mcrcim mcgill edu you can ftp caveat emptor versions from one three two two zero six one one in x xrlogin c and x xrlogind c the program packages up term and display into a single string which is stuffed into term rlogin then propagates term normally your cshrc on the remote machine should contain eval xrlogind where xrlogind is a program that checks term and if it is of the special format it recognizes unpacks it and spits out setenv and unsetenv commands to recreate the environment variables one one nine zero in addition if all you need to do is start a remote x process on another host and you find rsh n usr bin x one one xterm display display too simple display must have your real hostname then this version of xrsh can be used to start up remote x processes the equivalent usage would be xrsh xterm bin sh start an x one one process on another host date eight dec eight eight zero six two nine three four gmt from chris torek rsh host n setenv display display exec case shell in

i design my own font one way is to use the bitmap client or some other bitmap editor e g sun s icon editor tool post processed with pbmplus to design the individual characters and then to do some large amount of post processing to concatenate them into the bdf format see ollie jones s article in the november nine one x journal for more information the r three contrib area in fonts utils and in clients xtroff contained a number of useful utilities including some to convert between bdf font format and a simple character format which can be edited with any text editor an easier way is to use the xfed client to modify an existing font a version is on the r four or r five x one one r five contrib tape in contrib clients xfed xfed is available for anonymous ftp on ftp informatik uni dortmund

one contrib subject three nine why does adding a font to the server not work sic after you have built the font using your system s font compiler installed it in some directory and run mkfontdir or your system s equivalent e g bldfamily for openwindows in that directory be sure to use xset fp dir to add that full path name to the server s font path or if the directory is already in the path use xset fp rehash so that the new fonts in that directory are actually found it is this last step that you re probably leaving out you can also use xset q to make sure that that directory is in the path sometimes your xset fp dir command fails with a badvalue error x error of failed request badvalue integer parameter out of range for operation major opcode of failed request five one x setfontpath this means the x server cannot find or read your font directory or that your directory does not look like a font directory to the server the mention of an integer parameter in the message is spurious is the font directory you re specifying readable from the server s file system remember it s the server not the client which interprets your font directory trouble in this area is especially likely when you issue an xset command with shell metacharacters in it e g xset fp myfonts and the server is an x terminal or managed by xdm is the directory really a font directory if you re running an mit server or most varieties of vendor servers look in the directory for the file fonts dir if you can t find that file run mkfontdir one if you re running openwindows look for the file families list if you can t find it run bldfamily one if you re in a site where some people run x one one rn servers and others run a proprietary server with nonstandard font formats openwindows for example make sure the font directory is right for the server you re using hint if the directory contains pcf and or snf files it won t work for open windows if the directory contains ff and or fb files it won t work

snftobdf one four is part of the bdftools package which is available from export lcs mit edu contrib bdftools tar z and from crl nmsu edu pub misc bdftools tar z two nine one subject four one what is a general method of getting a font in usable format der mouse s getbdf is one solution it connects to a server and produces a bdf file for any font the server is willing to let it it can be used as an anything to bdf converter but requires access to a server that can understand the font file thus is both more and less powerful than other tools such as snftobdf getbdf is on one three two two zero six one one in x getbdf c or available via mail from mouse larry mcrcim mcgill edu five nine one in addition the r five program fstobdf can produce bdf for any font that the r five server has access to subject four two how do i use decwindows fonts on my non decwindows server the decwindows fonts typically don t exist on a non dec installation but rewrite rules can be used to alias fonts used by decwindows applications to standard mit fonts of similar characteristics and size pick up the file contrib decwindows on x one one r four font aliases from export lcs mit edu this file is for a standard mit r four server it can also serve as a starting point for creating a similar aliases file for the open windows server or other servers which do not use the mit font scheme subject four three how do i add bdf fonts to my decwindows server the format of fonts preferred by dec s x server is the pcf format you can produce this compiled format from the bdf format by using dec s dxfc font compiler note that the dec servers can also use raw bdf fonts with a performance hit subject four four how can i set backgroundpixmap in a defaults file what is xpm i want to be able to do something like this xclock backgroundpixmap usr include x one one bitmaps rootweave you can t do this the backgroundpixmap resource is a pixmap of the same depth as the screen not a bitmap which is a pixmap of depth one because of this writing a generic string to pixmap converter is impossible since there is no accepted convention for a file format for pixmaps therefore neither the x toolkit or the athena widget set define a string to pixmap converter because there is no converter you cannot specify this value as a resource the athena widget set does define a string to bitmap converter for use in many of its widgets however courtesy chris d peterson now kit ics com four nine zero however a specific converter which encapsulates much of the functionality of the xloadimage package by jim frost was posted one two nine zero by sebastian wangnick basti unido informatik uni dortmund de it permits loading of a number of image formats as a pixmap the leading general purpose format for pixmaps is the
