 from troll sug org a newman subject re trouble compiling x one one r five on sunos four one three article i d world c five two nbl u five organization sun user group lines one nine two nntp posting host bridge sug org in article casper fwi uva nl casper h s dik writes epstein trwacs fp trw com jeremy epstein writes dmm head cfa harvard edu david meleedy writes there s a bug in sunos four one three which is alluded to in the faq although there it s talking about x one one r four as being affected you need to force libxmu to be linked statically rather than dynamically which works around the linker error the simplest thing to do is edit each of the makefiles where there s a failure and change the line which reads xmulib l xmusrc lxmu to xmulib l xmusrc bstatic lxmu bdynamic no this is only relevant for openwindows three x as shipped with sunos it is not relevant for mit r five mit r five should compile without problems casper i don t know how many hours you ve spent on this but the sun user group makes x one one r five available on cd rom to its members the one nine nine two one disk has both sources and binaries and it sells for five zero i ve tagged a table of contents and an

cdrom priced at five zero to sug members including a caddy sug s emphasis has always been on supplying the greatest possible service and value added to our members last year the sug one nine nine one disk contained plug and play x one one r four two zero mb of additional essential binaries almost two zero zero mb of sun patches fully indexed archives of sun related net postings priced at only two five zero our aim this year has been to reduce the price for disks which can be produced inexpensively but to continue to supply as much value added as possible to accomplish this we will be putting out a two disk set the first containing what s ready and needed now the second available later in nine two containing more sparc binaries and other useful material not found on previous disks the sug one nine nine two one disk which was assembled by robert a bruce contains a lot of essential source code and we decided it would be a great service to make it available right away to our members and this pricing makes this a good opportunity to become a member for five zero per disk including one of those hard to find caddies if you are not a sug member you can become one for an additional four zero if you live within the us or five five outside the sug one nine nine two one cdrom is an iso nine six six zero disk which means it can be used by pc macintosh and other workstations as well and contains a total of five four three mb of material including x one one r five sources and core binaries for sparc as of several weeks after the initial distribution thus four fixes and the the mit
