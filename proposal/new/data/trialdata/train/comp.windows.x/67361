 from jgealow mtl mit edu jeffrey c gealow subject standard colormaps organization mit microsystems technology laboratories lines four nine distribution world nntp posting host mtl mit edu i m working on an x one one r five application and have concerns regarding standard colormaps the x one one r five documentation says usually a window manager creates these colormaps i wonder what window manager the writer had in mind neither twm or mwm seem to create standard colormaps of course one can use xstdcmap to create standard colormaps however xstdcmap doesn t seem to try very hard to avoid conflicts with the default colormap when i use standard colormaps created by xstdcmap the rest of my display goes black so it seems as if use of standard colormaps causes the very problem standard colormaps are intended to avoid perhaps if every application used standard colormaps things would be wonderful but not many applications seem to use standard colormaps finally the operation of the functions xmugetcolormapallocation xmustandardcolormap and xmucreatecolormap seem inconsistent with the section one four three of the x one one r five xlib documentation according to the section one four three of the x one one r five xlib documentation p four three six for grayscale colormaps only the colormap red max red mult and base pixel members are defined the other members are ignored to compute a grayscale pixel value use the following expression gray red mult base pixel zero xffffffff xmugetcolormapallocation defined in mit lib xmu cmapalloc c is used by xmulookupstandardcolormap defined in mit lib xmu lookupcmap c to select red max green max and blue max values for the call to xmustandardcolormap when the rgb gray map property is specified xmugetcolormapallocation sets red max to three zero of the total number of cells in the gray scale sets green max to five nine of the total number and sets blue max ot one one of the total number referring to section one four three one would expect xmugetcolormapallocation to set red max to the total number of cells in the gray scale when the rgb gray map property is specified xmustandardcolormap defined in mit lib xmu stdcmap c sets red mult green mult and blue mult all equal to one referring to section one four three one would expect green mult and blue mult to be ignored when red mult green mult and blue mult all equal one xmucreatecolormap defined in mit lib xmu crcmap c constructs a gray map the sum of red max green max and blue max gives the maximum gray value referring to section one four three on would expect red max to give the maximum gray value
