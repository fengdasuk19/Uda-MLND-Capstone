xstuff expo lcs mit edu the subject line send fixes where is the name of the patch and is usually just the number of the patch here are a few complications one fix five is in four parts you need to request five a five b five c and five d separately two the file sungx uu which was part of an earlier patch was re released with patch seven note the file doesn t work with solaris three fix eight is

two two is in nine parts two two a through two two i subject five nine what is the xstuff mail archive the xstuff server is a mail response program that means that you mail it a request and it mails back the response any of the four possible commands must be the first word on a line the xstuff server reads your entire message before it does anything so you can have several different commands in a single message unless you ask for help the xstuff server treats the subject header line just like any other line of the message the archives are organized into a series of directories and subdirectories each directory has an index and each subdirectory has an index the top level index gives you an overview of what is in the subdirectories and the index for each subdirectory tells you what is in it one the command help or send help causes the server to send you a more detailed version of this help file two if your message contains a line whose first word is index then the server will send you the top level index of the contents of the archive if there are other words on that line that match the name of subdirectories then the indexes for those subdirectories are sent instead of the top level index for example you can say send index fixes or index fixes a message that requests an index cannot request data three if your message contains a line whose first word is send then the xstuff server will send you the item s named on the rest of the line to name an item you give its directory and its name for example send fixes one four eight a eight b nine you may issue multiple send requests the xstuff server contains many safeguards to ensure that it is not monopolized by people asking for large amounts of data the mailer is set up so that it will send no more than a fixed amount of data each day if the work queue contains more requests than the day s quota then the unsent files will not be processed until the next day whenever the mailer is run to send its day s quota it sends the requests out shortest first four some mailers produce mail headers that are unusable for extracting return addresses if you use such a mailer you won t get any response if you happen to know an explicit path you can include a line like path foo bar bitnet mitvma mit edu or path bar foo frotz in the body of your message and the daemon will use it the xstuff server itself can be reached at xstuff expo lcs mit edu if your mailer deals in notation try sending to mit eddie expo lcs mit edu xstuff based on information from the mit x consortium eight eight nine four nine zero
