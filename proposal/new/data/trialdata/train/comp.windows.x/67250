 from dbrooks osf org david brooks subject re q colormaps with dialog shells organization open software foundation lines two nine dyoung media mit edu david young writes i have an applicationshell which uses a colormap created with xcreatecolormap and uses all of the colors available for my eight bit display when i popup a dialogshell to prompt the user for some input i want the xmndialogstyle to be set to xmdialog primary application modal the result is that if my cursor is over the dialogshell i get my colormap but if the cursor is over the applicationshell or any window other than the dialogshell i get the default colormap but i d like it so that if my cursor is over any window of my application i get my colormap i think this is correct behavior remember the default colormapfocuspolicy is keyboard meaning the cmap focus follows the keyboard focus since the dialog is modal mwm won t allow keyboard focus onto your main shell and so it won t allow cmap focus either since it sounds as though you have keyboardfocuspolicy pointer i suggest you set colormapfocuspolicy pointer also that way the cmap focus won t slavishly follow keyboard focus but will beat its own path if you have keyboardfocuspolicy explicit you can set cmap focus explicit also but you then need a binding to f focus color probably on mb one david brooks dbrooks osf org open software foundation uunet osf org dbrooks showres soote my foote
