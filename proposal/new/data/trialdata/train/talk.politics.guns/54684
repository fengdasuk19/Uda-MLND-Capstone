bytes received in five seconds four kbytes s you can repeat the get command for every file you want to retreive you can use the mget command to retreive multiple files if the file you want is in a subdirectory for example congress one zero three rd hr one zero two five you should change your directory to the appropriate subdirectory first and then retrieve it cd congress one zero three rd get hr one zero two five once you re finished you can log off with the command quit if you have a file you want to contribute the procedure is a little different first of all you should find out if the file already exists so get a copy of the index file with the procedure above and look it over to make sure you wouldn t repeat an entry the index will have a description of each of the files in the rkba directory for example file whitemanslaw white man s law by william r tonso from the december one nine eight five reason magazine once you ve determined you won t be duplicating an entry login and change to the incoming directory command see above once you are in the incoming directory use the command put file name in this case put whitemanslaw again there ll be a transfer complete so many bytes transfered in so many seconds message now your file is on the archive machine another thing to watch out for is duplicate file names be sure there isn t a file in the incoming directory that is called the same as the file you want to write if you use the same name you ll overwrite the previous file or you ll get an error message your file may have to be renamed if there is a conflict with a file by the same name in the rkba directory once your file is in the incoming directory send me an entry for the index file and i will add it to the file if you cannot use anonymous ftp and would still like to contribute a file email the file to me and i ll take care of the rest if you submit a file and do not notify me it may be removed so be sure to let me know first if you have any
