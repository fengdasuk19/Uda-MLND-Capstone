 from kkopp uxh cso uiuc edu koppenhoefer kyle cramm subject re two we re undertaxed poll organization university of illinois at urbana lines three nine kennejs a cs okstate edu kennedy james scot writes in article akasacou alfred carleton ca alexander kasacous writes in article veal utkvm one utk edu david veal writes no what you said was that we had spent money on guns rather than people as canada does which is ridiculous once again i have over estimated the general level of intellegence of the average reader of rush limbaugh canada per capita spend more money on people where the us spend more money per capita on guns what exactly do you mean when you say the u s spends more per capita on guns than canada does are you talking about the u s government or are you talking about the purchase of guns by private citizens or both if you are referring to private citizens then your point is irrevelant because what individuals do with their money is essentially their business if on the other hand you meant that the u s government spends more per capita on guns than canada does then your point is relevant so if this is true then the u s needs to get its priorities straight people are more important than guns that is not to say that guns aren t important i m just saying that if the u s government does spend more per capita on guns than they do on people then something is awry he meant the us spends more per capita on guns than canada which isn t really surprising because we were so busy protecting the western world from the ussr that all other countries could slack off on their defense spending i would like to see if the us spends more per capita on people than canada does this is a true apples apples comparison where the previous post was apples oranges
