 from fcrary ucsu colorado edu frank crary subject re gun control was re we re mad as hell at the tv news nntp posting host ucsu colorado edu organization university of colorado boulder distribution na lines five nine in article manes magpie linknet com steve manes writes i don t know how anyone can state that gun control could have no effect on homicide rates i don t think anyone is arguing that there would be no effect but there would be no net positive effect you also have to consider the negative side law abiding citizens armed with fireamrs pistols for the most part prevent between eight zero zero zero zero national crime survey and one zero zero zero zero zero zero dr kleck crimes each year those are the extremes most studies find the number to be five zero zero zero zero zero to six zero zero zero zero zero about one of those crimes are homicides so private ownership of firearms saves approximately five zero zero zero lives each year there are roughly one two zero zero zero criminal homicides and fatal accidents involving guns each year for there to be any net benefit you would have to show that gun control measures would disarm over four zero of the criminals currently using guns that would be very hard to do according the the federal batf only eight of criminals buy their guns over the counter since gun control laws by their very nature only effect legal sales such a law would remove all the benefits of armed law abiding citizens while having only a minimal effect on armed criminals who by and large get their guns illegally that doesn t sound like a net benefit to me there were over two five zero accidental homicides in america in one nine nine zero most with licensed weapons since most were with licensed weapons i assume you are not supporting reasonable laws i e waiting periods background checks licenses etc since only a complete ban would alter the statistic you refer to i assume that s what you are supporting by the way one one three five people dies in one nine eight six from falling down stairs two five zero accidental handgun deaths isn t significant next to other household accidents more american children accidentally shot other children last year one five than all the handgun homicides in great britain one zero eight zero children under the age of one zero died by drowning six nine from drinking poisonous household chemicals like drano one three nine from falls if the real goal is to reduce the tragic accidental deaths of children wouldn t a ban on drain cleaners be a better palce to start or perhaps restricting ownership to professionals like plumbers please no dictionary arguments about rates vs total numbers okay they re offered for emphasis not comparison while you might call it emphasis refering to completely two statistics in the same sentence implies a comparison if it isn t valid and you put the numbers together to convince people you are right the kindest thing i could call it is propaganda frank crary cu boulder
