 from andy sail stanford edu andy freeman subject re ban all firearms organization computer science department stanford university lines three eight as quoted from by jrm gnv ifas ufl edu firearms tend to fall into this low dollar pound area it would not be economic to smuggle them in that depends only on the profit of doing so the differences in cost of production will determine local vs smuggle would have to be local there are not all that many people who have both the skill and motivation to assemble worthwhile those of us who have actually made semi autos full autos are easier are getting quite a giggle out of this i d estimate that five of the people at my high school couldn t do it i was one of the few who failed shop people who have actually seen me do mechanical work would probably say that one is more like it starting with even nine zero of the population you can be sure that enough people will be motivated firearms from scratch high ranking crime figures could obtain imported uzis and such but the average person and average thug would be lucky to get a zip gun and would pay through the nose for it how much is through the nose after all we know quite a bit about how much a gun is worth to a criminal so if that is dwarfed by the price demanded by the bad part of that nine zero the relevant economic analysis has been made the profit of gun crime is high enough that the price required to push criminals out of the market is high enough that everyone will be motivated that analysis ignored some improvements in the criminal gun market that could make them even cheaper they re not efficiently used now but a loaner set up would drive the value still higher without affecting criminal use andy
