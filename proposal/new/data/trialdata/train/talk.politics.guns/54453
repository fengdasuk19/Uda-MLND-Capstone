 from jrutledg cs ulowell edu john lawrence rutledge subject re some more about gun control organization interactive media group university of massachusetts at lowell lines one four six in article cescript mtu edu charles scripter writes this mention of a well regulated militia is what confuses me according to the federalist paper s a well regulated militia has a well defined structure and follows nationally uniform regulations perhaps you should actually read the federalist papers perhaps you should reread federal two nine which deals exclusively with the well regulated malitia here is what is says about its character to oblige the great body of the yeomanry and of the other classes of the citizens to be under arms for the purpose of going through military exercises and evolutions as often as might be necessary to acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the character of a well regulated militia it also talks about the well regulated militia having a nationally uniform in structure and disipline i will note you did quote the end of this particular paragraph which states little more can reasonably be aimed at with respect to the people at large than to have them properly armed and equipped and in order to see that this be not neglected it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year but do you knew how much organization is required to training a large group of poeple twice a year just to try to get the same people every year provide a basic training to new people so they can be integrated into the force and find a suitable location it requires a continually standing committee of organizers since a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure and disipline and meet once or twice a year to train how can you claim a well regulated militia is not well organized but i will concide a well organized militia is not necessarily a well regulated militia several people have stated that the well organized militia is what is defined under one zero usc three one one which states the militia of the united states consists of all able bodied males at least one seven years of age and except as provided in section three one three of title three two under four five years of age who are or who have made a declaration of intention to become citizens of the united states and of female citizents of the united states who are commissioned officers of the national guard this deos define the militia but were is the adjective well regulated one zero usc three one one does not define a well regualed militia in any way shape or form it only defines who can become part of a well regulated militia the federalist papers clearly define the well regualed militia as a proper subset of the militia in the same paragraph quoted above it talk above disciplining all the militia of the united states so they fit the character of a well regulated militia this is what the paragraph states about the associated costs it would form an annual deduction from the productive labor of the country to an amount which calculating upon the present numbers of the people would not fall far short of the whole expense of the civil establishments of all the states to attempt a thing which would abridge the mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent would be unwise and the experiment if made could not succeed because it would not long be endured another quote provide by charles scripter is james madison federalist paper four one regarding the general welfare clause nothing is more natural nor common than first to use a general phrase and then to explain and qualify it by a recital of particulars so the phrase the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed must either qualify or explain the phrase a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the definition of explain as stated in the american hertitage dictionary of the enlish language the new college edition one nine eight two is one to make plain or comprehensible remove obscruity from elucidate it was the economists who undertook to explain this puzzle two to define explicate expound he explained his plan three to offer reasons for or a cause of an answer for justify explain an error the second phrase clearly does not explain the first therefore the second phrase must qualify the first the definition given for qualify is one to describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities of characterize two to make competent or suitable for office position or task three to give legal power to make legally capable four to modify limit or restrict as giving exceptions five to make less harsh or severe moderate six grammar to modify the meaning of a word or phrase since the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed does not describe modify or make less harsh anything and it has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task by process of elimination it must fall into definition three and since three deals with legal power the same thing the constitution does it must be the correct definition in this case therefore the right of the people to keep and bear arms gives legal power to the well regualated militia and this legal power shall not be infringed i thank you very much mr scripter you have provided me with more evidence that the second amendment only concerns itseft with the people s right to form well regulate militia and says very little about the right of an untrained person to keep and bear a five zero caliber machine gun and since i totally untrained in the use of any firearm something i personly have meant to correct by going to a nra gun safety course and joining a gun club cannot legally buy such a machine gun i conclude the courts and democraticly elected congress agree with me so now we know which category mr rutledge is in he means to destroy our liberties and rights i mean to destory our liberties and rights is that why a participate in the discussion of exactly what our libertues and rights are i force my version of our liberties and rights by begining statements of what our liberties and rights with all that the second amendment clearly states to me using expressions such as states to me clearly mean i intend to force my views on others i don t think so so in effort not to force my views and not to destory our liberties and rights i state that nothing i have written or will write in the matter of liberties and rights is the final word for i am only one person among many and the final word on liberties and rights cleary and irrevocably belongs to the many if only it were a modern document with a john lawrence rutledge smart index and hyper links
