 from rats cbnewsc cb att com morris the cat subject vancouver seattle study critiques organization at their aggressiveness in making arrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions arrest rates for other offenses conviction rates actual sentences imposed for gun related crimes violent crimes without guns or gun law violations or incarceration rates whereas social scientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences the authors of the nejm tale of two cities fail even to mention most factors related to crime control eight the authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective means for protection unless the criminal is killed such is not the case criminologists ref five eight have found that almost six five zero zero zero zero americans annually use handguns for protection from criminals and that using a gun for protection reduces the liklihood that a crime rape robbery assault will be completed by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury to the victim it is interesting nonetheless that the authors reported the same number four of civilian justifiable homicides without firearms in each city but that less restrictive seattle accounted for one zero zero of the reported civilian justifiable homicides involving firearms nine the centers for disease control which funded the study editorially praised the paper ref nine saying it applied scientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb advocates of stricter regulation of firearms particularly handguns there is nothing in the paper which could possibly be mistaken for scientific methods by a sociologists or criminologists the vancouver seattle study is the equivolent of testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding two ordinary looking middle class white males one aged two five and the other four zero and without first taking their vital signs administering the experimental drug to the two five year old while giving the four zero year old a placebo then taking their blood pressure and on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure announcing in a special article a new medical breakthrough it would be nice to think that such a study would neither be funded by the cdc or printed by the nejm since the longstanding anti gun biases of the nejm and the cdc make them willing to present shoddy research as scientific breakthroughs in special articles and editorials relating to firearms we are obligated to correct the record by notifying the news media and those with congressional and executive oversight over the activities of the centers for disease control about the distortions contained in handgun regulations crime assaults and homicides a tale of two cities and firearm injuries a call for science clearly all scientific

eight nine issue of reason free minds indeed they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point does not exist they offer two fragments of inferential data in support of the claim that guns are more available in seattle but for all anybody knows as a matter of empirical fact the opposite could be true we are therefore being asked at the conclusion of the study to believe that a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established indeed the situation is even more troublesome the first of the two indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed weapons permits issued in seattle and the number of restricted weapons permits issued in vancouver differences between the two cities in the permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable the second bit of evidence is cook s gun prevalence index which stands at four one percent for seattle but only one two percent for vancouver cook s index however does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in various cities it measures gun misuse it is an average of the percentage of homicides and suicides involving firearms in the present case the index shows only that in homicides and suicides firearms are more likely to be used in seatte than in vancouver to take cook s index as a measure of general firearms availability it must be assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides is directly related to their relative availability in the general population but this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove to assume what one is seeking to prove then to prove it on the basis of that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything even if we were to grant on the basis of no compelling evidence that guns are less common in vancouver we might still question what causes what the authors attribute seattle s higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun ownership but it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns in other words that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership not vice versa in fact it was once commonly argued that great britain s low rate of violent crime was a function of that nation s strict gun laws and the consequent low rate of gun ownership until british researcher colin greenwood found that great britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted to invoke an ancient methodological saw correlation is not cause nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data on gun ownership the authors say seattle and vancouver are similar in many ways implying that they differ mainly in gun availability gun law stringency and crime rates this is an evident attempt to establish the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis that all else is equal among things being compared clearly the two cities are similar in some ways but a closer look reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime or homicide rates the cities are closely matched in what percentage of their population is white seven nine percent and seven six percent but seattle is about one zero percent black while vancouver is less than zero five percent vancouver s minority population is overwhelmingly asian so although the authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half dozen readily available demographic indicators they have not shown that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out in fact the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is particularly relevant in light of the study s breakdown of homicide rates according to the race of the victim for the white majority the homicide rates are nearly identical six two per one zero zero zero zero zero in seattle six four in vancouver the differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities for blacks the observed difference in homicide rate is three six six to nine five and for hispanics two six nine to seven nine methodoligical complexities render the asian comparison problematic but it too is higher in seattle than in vancouver racial minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in seattle than in vancouver the white majority is equally likely to be slain in either city since the nearly two one initial difference in homicide reates between the cities is due exclusively to three one or four one differences between minority groups it is fair to ask why postulated difference in gun availability or gun law strigency would matter so dramatically to minorities but not matter at all to whites can differential gun availability explain why blacks and hispanics but not whites are so much more likely to be killed in seattle than in vancouver studies in the united states incidentally do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership or are other explanations more plausible could the disparity between canadian and american rates of poverty among racial minorities have anything to do with it what are the relative rates of drug or alcohol abuse of homelessness among each cty s minority population the city of seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the mississippi unemployment among young central city nonwhite men in the united states usually exceeds four zero percent what is the comparable canadian percentage the crucial point is that canada and the united states differ in many ways as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries absent more detailed analysis nearly any of these many ways might explain part or all of the difference in homicide rates in gross comparisons such as those between seattle and vancouver all else is not equal the authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide result in a complex picture they do not acknowledge that the ensuing complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument they also acknowledge that socio economic status is probably an important confounding factor in our comparison remarking further that blacks in vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in one nine eight one than the rest of vancouver s population given the evidence presented in the article it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between seattle and vancouver results from greater proverty among seattle s racial minorities but the authors pay no further attention to this possibility since detailed information about household incomes according to race is not available for vancouver the largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple example if one were to take all u s couties and compare them in terms of one pervalence of gun ownership and two crime or homicide rates one would find an astonishing pattern counties with more guns have less crime would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce crime or would one insist that other variables also be taken into account in this example the hidden variable is city size guns are more common in small towns and rural areas whereas crime is a big city problem if researchers failed to anticipate this variable or lacked the appropriate data to examine its possible consequences they coud be very seriously misled in the study at hand the authors matched two cities for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables and their results are impossible to interpret in the editorial firearm injuries a call for science accompanying the study two officials from the centers for disease control lauded the authors for applying scientific methods to a problem of grave public heath significance but in attempting to draw causal conclusions from nonexperimental research the essence of scientific method is to anticipate plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them out absent such effort the results may well seem scientific but are little more than polemics masquerading as serious research that this study is but one of a number of
