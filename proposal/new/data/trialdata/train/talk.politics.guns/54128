 organization university of illinois at chicago academic computer center from jason kratz subject re my gun is like my american express card distribution usa lines seven three in article vincent cad gatech edu vincent fox says stuff deleted all mine define armed better go shoot a revolver and a semi auto like the colt four five does one fires faster than the other nope aside from which faster rate of fire is usually not desirable sure it makes the other guys duck for cover but just you trying hitting anything with a thompson in hose mode this is why the military is limiting it s m one six now to aw come on it worked great in the one nine two zero s or the movie version of the two zero s anyways three round burst fire simple semi auto would be better but the troops like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo something often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful a revolver is equally capable as a semi auto in the same caliber stuff deleted about how revolvers are just as good as semi autos all your points are very well taken and things that i haven t considered as i am not really familiar enough with handguns some police departments switched to glocks and then started quietly switching many officers back to the old revolvers too many were having accidents partly due to the poor training they received not that glocks require rocket scientists but some cops are baffled by something as complex as the timer on a vcr hell a glock is the last thing that should be switched to the only thing that i know about a glock is the lack of a real safety on it sure there is that little thing in the trigger but that isn t too great of a safety anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun the police don t know nothing about firearms turn off cops and hunter and pay attention i do not seek here to say semi autos are junk merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid a cop with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than equipped for anything short of a riot actually i don t watch those shows and you re right at least partially i don t know much about handguns i m more familiar with rifles gun control is hitting what you aim at if you whip out a wonder nine and fire real fast you may find you don t hit anything good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit i own a nine mm beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon to something like the ruger security six revolver if i haven t hit what i m aiming at in the first five shots something is quite seriously wrong somewheres while i might like having the backup capacity of those extra shots in certain cases overwhelmingly the of shots fired in criminal encounters is less than five what do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime why the same nice simple three eight revolvers that the police often use well actually some police prefer the much heftier three five seven magnum but anyway obplea don t flame me i prefer semi autos for most things but they introduce unneccessary complications to something as nerve wracking as an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal if everything had gone as planned everything would have been perfect batf spokesperson on cnn three two nine three regarding failed raid attempt in tx no flames here all your points are well taken guess i still have a lot to learn but thanks to this discussion i already am guess i assume too many things like more bullets are better and that sort of thing of course you know what happens when you assume jason
