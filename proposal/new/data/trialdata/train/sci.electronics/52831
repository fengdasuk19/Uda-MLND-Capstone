 from ubsiler msuvx one memst edu subject home made ir remote extender organization memphis state university lines one nine here s a question for all you electrical engineers out there i bought an infrared detector module at radio shack for three nine five it is a little gizmo that senses infrared remotes and produces an output signal then i hooked the output through a transistor to an infrared led the circuit works like a minature remote control extender in my car all remote commands are relayed to the cd player hidden in the glove compartment it works fine with my denon cd player but when i tried to build the same circuit for a friend s vcr it didn t work the circuit appears to work for other remotes you can see infrared with a sony ccd camcorder but coincidentally it only seems to work for my cd player any advice would be appreciated brian ubsiler msuvx one memst edu
