 from alung megatest com aaron lung subject re what are some good suppliers of chips organization megatest corporation lines four four in article ae four five four cleveland freenet edu paul simundza writes anyone know of any good supplier s of chips one that could have almost any chip i need i don t want to hunt down all the chips i may need so it would be greatly appreciated if anyone knows of a good distributor thankyou paul unfortunately there are not too many retail outlets that ll stock just about every chip made the stuff they will stock are the ones that ll sell like standard dram s eight zero three eight six s six eight zero zero zero s etc etc i e i cna t think of any one stop shopping store the closest you can get is to pick up a copy of byte magazine or the circuit cellar popular electronics and the like and flip through them distributors like wyle electronics hamilton avnet pioneer electronics etc etc don t normally deal with end users like ourselves where we only a couple of everything they only deal with people who buy by the hundreds or more each distributor represents and sells a variety of different non competing manufacturers what do i mean by this suppose abc electronics sells intel eight zero three eight six s it s a pretty good bet that they won t be selling any of amd s three eight six s or vice versa they also can obtain just about any chip you want from a manufacturer they represent who knows you might be lucky to be able to buy from one of them but i d be suprised if you do also bear in mind that the one or two qty prices they will charge you will be much greater than what a mail order outlet will charge my advice if you re gonna be designing anything try to stick with off the shelf stuff you re going to get stuck if you use too many esoteric parts sooner or later good luck aaron
