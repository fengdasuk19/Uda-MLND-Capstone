 from acollins uclink berkeley edu andy collins subject voltage regulation and current limiting organization university of california berkeley lines three seven nntp posting host uclink berkeley edu summary need help one not so quick question to throw out there for you guys for our class project we need to design and build a power supply to the following specs voltatge adjustable from one one two v current limited at one a voltage must stay within two of designated value for i from zero one a ac ripple less than five mv rms of course we can t just use an adjustable voltage current limiting regulator chip our problem is with the current limiting i e we ve found stuff to do the rest of the parts of the circuit what the supply must do if presented with a load which would draw more than one a given the supply voltage is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal one amp thus if we were to short the thing with the ammeter we should read one amp if we measure the current through a one ohm resistor at one two v we should read one amp and the output voltage by necessity must be one v the only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output power transistor and therefore reduce the output so does anybody have any ideas we could work from thanks in advance andy collins kc six yey acollins uclink berkeley edu ps if anybody wants to flame this as a stupid project i agree fully but i still have to do it its graded
