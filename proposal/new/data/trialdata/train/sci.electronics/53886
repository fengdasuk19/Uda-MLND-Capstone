 from squish endor uucp shishin yamada subject re atari two six zero zero processors organization aiken computation lab harvard university lines four two in article writes does anyone know what processor the atari two six zero zero used what i m looking for is th e pin outs for the atari two six zero zero the schematics for it it does anyone have any idea where i could find this or any related information this is very impor tant also are the rom chips that were used fo rthe two six zero zero games still available or were they propreitary please email me with any responces as this is very important thanks a million btw anyone who works has worked for atari i could really use your help with i nfo on the old two six zero zero please email me if you are willing to help me thatnks alot peter the atari two six zero zero used a six five zero two cpu just like their entire eight bit line four zero zero eight zero zero one two zero zero one four zero zero one four four zero one three zero xe six five xe computers as well as the five two zero zero game machine the two six zero zero had some extra asic chips that were basically modified graphics chips and pia s for the joysticks later model two six zero zero might have incorporated many of the chips into one asci as the weight of the machines and part count decreased a lot over the years additionally i think the two six zero zero used two k four k and up to eight k of rom for their games i have no idea how much ram it had to work with but i would hazard a guess of two or four k ram think comes from a lot of hacking with the eight zero zero and one three zero xe computers and occasionally hacking with the two six zero zero fixing it for monitor composite video use and audio hookups also i tryed to make a cartridge less system that stored the rom into a ram cartridge that could be loaded up at some prior time a way to backup cartridges i ve heard of a setup like this where games could be bought cheaply on fsk recorded tapes then you would load them into a special ram cartidge and play them anyways if you re interested in looking for two six zero zero equipment we ve got two two six zero zero machines around one composite a v modified and lotsa cartridges willing to sell for reasonable offer shipping and handling don t play it anymore since going to computers nintendo interested in that too hope that helps your question i might grab some six five zero two s out too since they must be fun to play with as microcontrollers shishin squish yamada squish endor harvard edu
