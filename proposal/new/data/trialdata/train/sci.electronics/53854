 from avm one nine nine three sigma tamu edu mamishev alexander valentino subject digital voltmeter how does it work organization texas a m university academic computing services lines three four distribution world nntp posting host sigma tamu edu news software vax vms vnews one four one hello let me introduce a problem when i measure a sinusoidal wave voltage with a digital voltmeter using ac mode my output is an rms value a peak value over two squared right when i measure a square wave in the same mode ac my output is equal to a peak value actually to the upper flat boundary of the wave i assumed that a digital voltmeter makes some kind of integration of the input value and divides it over the wave period right now i used it to measure the same square wave as above but distorted by high frequency harmonics ideally output should be the same but the output value was only about one zero of the previous one why what is the nature of this output value what does the voltmeter actually measure and what does it show related question less important to me what are advantages and disadvantages of digital voltmeters to compare with analog ones thank you for your attention you could mail me your opinion at avm one nine nine three zeus tamu edu or open a discussion here i would appreciate either way alexander v mamishev power system automation laboratory phone office four zero nine eight four five four six two three department of electrical engineering phone home four zero nine eight four six five eight five zero texas a m university fax four zero nine eight six two two two eight two college station tx seven seven eight four three usa internet avm one nine nine three zeus tamu edu
