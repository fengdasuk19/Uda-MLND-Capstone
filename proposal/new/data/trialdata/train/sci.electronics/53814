 from wout dutentb et tudelft nl wout serdijn subject re how can zero zero two two uf be different from two zero zero four seven in series nntp posting host duteela et tudelft nl organization delft university of technology dept of electrical engineering lines four three in mg cs princeton edu michael golan writes i was looking at the amps diagram for sony one zero nine zero two zero nine zero receivers and i was amazed to find a difference between the us and canadian model on the capacitor s that hangs off the output to the speakers to speaker identical both models from amp idnetical both models zero zero two two canadian model only us model zero zero four seven and world wide model only candian model only zero zero four seven gound the board itself is also identical with room for all three caps the us can versions is clearly indicated in both places how does that make sense zero zero four seven two is zero zero two three five essentially zero zero two two for caps there are just standard caps no special w type precision please explain this michael golan mg cs princeton edu the only explanation i can think of is that two capacitors in series can handle twice the output voltage sometimes two elco s in antiseries you know positive sides facing eachother are used to obtain a large capacitor that can handle positive and negative voltages as well so there probably is no design philosophical reason but a production cost one best seven three s wouter
