 from vanderby mprgate mpr ca david vanderbyl subject re mysterious tv problem source nntp posting host chip reply to vanderby mprgate mpr ca david vanderbyl organization mpr teltech ltd lines three zero llbgb utxdp dp utexas edu writes initial symptoms no picture or sound crt filament does not glow flyback ticking as described abovew discovered when hooked up the scope if strip is not putting out audio or video signals everything is making simple two zero three zero hz pulses horiz out transistor collector case of the to three is a two zero three zero hz downgoing sawtooth with ca one five khz ring at front end guys what s going on here anyone seen this before what is happening is this one you turn the tv on two the horizontal output begins normal operation this powers up the high voltage and most of the rest of the circuitry three a problem is sensed and the horizontal oscillator shuts down four after it powers down the cycle repeats things to check first check for a shorted high power component your best bet is the vertical output transistor s or if there is one the voltage regulator the most common cause of this type of failure is too much current being drawn somewhere also look for shutdown circuits which your tv may or may not have if you can find one that is shutting down the horizontal oscillator then it shouldn t be too hard to find the problem from there
