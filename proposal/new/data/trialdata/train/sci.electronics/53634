 from pmalenfa kitkat webo dg com paul malenfant subject optoisolator interfacing questions reply to pmalenfa kitkat webo dg com paul malenfant organization data general corporation westboro ma lines two six i am interfacing some simple circuits that run on nine v to my cpu board which runs at five six v the optoisolator is a four n three five on the led side i put the signal i want through a one zero k resistor to the base of a two n two two two two on the transistor side i tie my cpu input line to the collector which has a pull up resistor of four seven k it functions ok but seems very slow i can detect pulses that occur at about two khz but not much faster isn t the rise fall time of this device something like five us i should be able to detect my target of four zero khz but i can t get one six khz this is done using wire wrap and the wires going to the cpu and to the test pin are about eight inches long but i m not doing anything high speed in the art of electronics it mentions tying the base of the phototransistor to ground through a resistor to improve the speed is that what i need to do how do i calculate the resistor value paul malenfant pmalenfa kitkat webo dg com five zero eight eight seven zero six four six zero
