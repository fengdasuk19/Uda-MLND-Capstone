 from scst eight three csc liv ac uk mr c d smith subject voltage multiplier problem organization computer science liverpool university lines five three nntp posting host goyt csc liv ac uk hi i ve just built a valve preamp and use a diode capacitor voltage multiplier to step the one two vac supply voltage up to approx two six zero vdv as the load resistance increases the rc constant decreases and hence the output voltage drops i need as high an output voltage as possible about two six zero v the circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages ie one four diodes and one four capacitors each capacitor develops about three eight v across them and i take the output from across seven capacitors two six zero v each capacitor is one zero zero mfd at six eight v if i increase each of the capacitors rating two two zero four seven zero mfd that will increase the rc constant and hence alleviate some of the problem these capacitors are going to be a little expensive as i need one four of them so one what would happen if i connected a four seven zero mfd at four zero zero v capacitor in parallel with the output and hence in parallel with the seven one zero zero mfd capacitors will it as i assume increase the c in circuit and hence increase the rc time constant if it does and my output voltage becomes more stable by doing this then i will have killed two birds with one stone as i am experiencing some five zero hz ripple and hence amp hum and this new capacitor will smooth this out and two can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor choke to be placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out the five zero hz mains hum lowest resistance possible i ve not got my preamp with me at the moment because it is too much of a distraction i m at university and i ve got to get my dissertation finished in two weeks hence i m mailing not playing with my solderoing iron it ll be cheaper too in the long run especially if one four new large capacitors don t work as planned email please can t always read the net thanks in advance chris name mr chris smith twang on that ole guitar addrs scst eight three uk ac liv csc uni liverpool university quest to build more and more hardware dgree computer science what ever the sun may be it is certainly not a ball of flaming gas d h lawrence all views expressed are my own and reflect that of private thought
