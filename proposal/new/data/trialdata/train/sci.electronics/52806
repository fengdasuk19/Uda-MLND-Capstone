 from paj uk co gec mrc paul johnson subject peltier effect heat pumps reply to paj uk co gec mrc paul johnson organization gec marconi research centre great baddow essex lines four five i was having a look through a couple of components catalogues when i came across a range of peltier effect heat pumps intended for cooling components for those who have not heard of this effect you put a current through one of these devices and it pumps heat from one side to the other reverse the current and you reverse the effect i think a temperature difference can give you an emf as well anyway it struck me that you could make a nice cool hot box for picnics with one of these a power regulator a thermostat and a couple of heat sinks the biggest device can shift six zero w with an efficiency of eight zero nine zero which ain t bad although it would flatten my car battery in about half an hour unfortunately the catalogue didn t list anything more than the basic specs as a heat pump i imagine that you would get a back emf as the temperature gradient across the device increases if so presumably its power decreases as the back emf increases until eventually we have a steady state with no current being consumed assuming no leakage if so then the final temperature difference between the two sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more although that would be a lousy way to control it what i would like to know is one are the above guesses correct two what is the open circuit thermal resistance of a typical device i just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm too fast when i unplug it three how does a peltier effect heat pump actually work it looks like magic four why don t they use these things in domestic fridges freezers thanks in advance paul paul johnson paj gec mrc co uk tel four four two four five seven three three three one ext three two four five these ideas and others like them can be had gec marconi research is not for zero zero two each from any reputable idealist responsible for my opinions
