 from kolstad cae wisc edu joel kolstad subject re can radio freq be used to measure distance organization u of wisconsin madison college of engineering lines two five in article rgc three six seven nine bcstec ca boeing com robert g carpenter writes i m wondering if it s possible to use radio waves to measure the distance between a transmitter s and receiver yes you could seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength and determine distance this would be for short distances two zero zero zero ft and i would need to have accuracy of six inches or so well letsee whipping out hp four eight sx soon to be gx six inches three one zero eight m s five nanoseconds resolution hmm that ll be rather difficult the more standard read better method is to use ultrasound generally somewhere around four zero khz sound travels a heck of a lot slower than light radio waves and is therefore much easier to deal with what frequencies would be best for this or does matter it might be easiest to visit a hardware store and look at the numerous sonic estimator type devices that do what you want here many are pretty cheap too three zero in fact for awhile the stanley estimator was selling for something like eight that s the one i bought joel kolstad
