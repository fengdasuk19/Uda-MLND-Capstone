 from tomb hplsla hp com tom bruhns subject re trace size for a one five amp supply organization hp lake stevens wa lines three four acollins uclink berkeley edu andy collins writes how thick do i need to make a pcb trace for one five amps of current and does anybody have any other thoughts on the process what kind of pcb to use materials thickness of copper any advice graciously accepted in four replies i ve seen no hard numbers so here goes for traces on the outside not inner layers expect in one oz copper at one five amps the following temperature rises versus width this is from sams reference data for engineers seventh edition pg five three zero which claims in turn to be from mil std two seven five c width temp rise inches degrees c one two five one zero zero one five seven five one seven six zero two zero four five two four three zero three three two zero at one zero amps the rise for the one two five width is only about three zero degrees power goes as square of the current plus the copper resistance goes up as temperature goes up certainly two zero five mm traces should be ample for what you want to do and two ounce copper almost cuts the required width in half i d do two oz at about zero zero eight width myself i think given that the rated current is one zero amps and the one five is a transient or fault condition there s another question will the voltage drop be low enough but you should be able to figure this one out with wire tables or just the resistivity of copper keep traces short and use separate sensing traces where appropriate as mentioned by another poster
