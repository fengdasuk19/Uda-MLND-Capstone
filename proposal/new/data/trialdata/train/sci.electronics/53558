 organization queen s university at kingston from subject re adc card for computer distribution world lines five four in article you say i would like to digitize the output of a squid magnetometer range one zero v to one zero v and do digital signal processing in a computer say a macintosh ii or a four eight six pc i would like a good one six bit adc with good linearity and a high conversion speed at least five zero khz preferably two zero zero khz other concerns two must i use an adc external to my computer to avoid digital noise feedback into my sensitive squid electronics might be a good idea the resolution you requested is about zero three mv in order to get what you ve paid for noise level better be lower than that it is kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expect inside a pc before you pay for a pc card test it out by sampling a low distortion sine wave i think there is a sine wave on a cd digital domain there are possibly other low thd sources run the digitized waveform through a fft transform and take alook at the noise floor on the spectrum that s should give you a good indication of the design that s what i am doing to test a data acquistion system i have designed i got the idea from maxim data sheet if you can live with one four bit resolution i would recommend looking at the max one two one from maxim it is a high speed three zero eight khz complete sampling a d with dsp interface the input range is five v and it uses a serial interface which can easily be optically isolated from the computer to elinimate a major noise source the analog design guide i got from them shows a one zero zero db noise level they claim a seven seven db max eight five typ thd looks pretty good for the one two one zero zero zero pieces a evaluation kit is available might want to give these nice folks a call one eight zero zero nine nine eight eight eight zero zero or fax four zero eight seven three seven seven one nine four and four zero eight seven three seven seven six zero zero ext four zero zero zero for application assistance this assumes that you can build your own das and write your own software hey you can get the max one two one as a free sample just by calling the one eight zero zero i would appreciate discussion of your personal experience with a mac or pc based adc system i would recommend you to find out the resolution that can be gotten out of your system by looking at the noise level otherwise you might be throwing out your money charles cunningham cec imager llnl gov k c lee elec eng grad student i have no connection with maxim except i do in general recommend companies that give samples to students to others i feel they deserve that for being nice to me
