 from wb nine omc dynamo ecn purdue edu duane p mantick subject re ir remote control receiver organization purdue university engineering computer network lines two nine ab six one six freenet carleton ca marc dion writes for a project of my own i would like to build a infra red remote control receiver for regular vcrs and tvs remotes does anybody have any info or tips on how to build such receiver in particular a which photo detector should i use which wavelength do remotes use b which ics or circuit should i use c any suggestions for circuit layout please reply to this group if you wish but as well via e mail my link to usenet is not always available i d like to see this info as well as for wavelength i think you re primarily going to find two eight eight zero nm a bit and or nine five zero nm a bit usually it is about one zero nm either way the two most common i have seen were eight eight zero and nine five zero but i have also heard of eight nine zero and nine four zero i m not sure that the one zero nm one way or another will make a great deal of difference another suggestion find a brand of tv that uses an ir remote and go look at the sams photofact for it you can often find some very detailed schematics and parts list for not only the receiver but the transmitter as well including carrier freq specs and tone decoding specs if the system uses that duane
