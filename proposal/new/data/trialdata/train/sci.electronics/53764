 from kubovich iastate edu mark w kubovich subject common mode noise and small signals keywords noise common mode organization iowa state university ames ia lines two zero i have never worked with really small signals before and have a few questions about low level noise i have noticed that the waveform synthesizer that i am using analogic two zero two zero has some relatively large common mode noise on it i am using this synthesizer to null out another transient waveform and am amplifying the difference two zero zero uv several hundred times the two zero two zero has about one three mvp p of common mode noise and this tends to make my measurements hard to repeat the noise is not quite in sync with line frequency and on a spectrum analyzer the main component is about six four hz how can i get rid of the noise when i look at the spectrum using an hp three five eight two a audio range analyzer the noise goes away the minute i switch to isolation on the input i am guessing the anlayzer has a diff amp on the input since it will read accurately down to dc also if i use a differential amplifier ia to solve the problem how important is it to use one of these shield drivers an amp connected to the shield in sort of a feedback loop to remove trouble caused by different cable capacitances if anyone can suggest a good ic ia for use with transient signals with content from one khz to about three zero zero khz i would appreciate it
