 from wb nine omc dynamo ecn purdue edu duane p mantick subject re long distance ir detection organization purdue university engineering computer network lines four four sburton dres dnd ca stan burton writes i would like to be able to detect the angular position low accuracy of an ir emitting source at a distance of about one zero zero meters more is better in daylight the ir source could be emitting a signature i m leaning toward three zero khz square wave with five zero duty cycle i am considering the use of a quadrant detector from centronic inc to give information to a pan tilt head to point the sensor and thus determine the angles for the source i am considering wazing the heck out of an ir led s possibly an optek op two nine zero or motorola mled eight one wazing would mean at least one amp current pulses at this current the duty cycle of the led drops to one zero and i would need to cycle five of them in turn to get the five zero required has anyone done something like this yeesh you will be nailing those irleds may i suggest getting your mitts on the siemens sfh four eight four two irled this unit is designed to take some big current pulses if you can get your duty cycle down a bit it will output nearly a watt nine seven five mw with real short duty cycle times nice thing about the sfh four eight four two is that it is cheap i got mine for about five zero cents a piece even though i had to buy one zero zero of them btw i have seen irleds with outputs up to six watts honest six watts i don t have the book here at work so i can t recall the company name the six watter ain t cheap around one zero eight but if you want some power mamamia that s pretty hot they also have a four watt a two watt and a one watt device in their line and will sell small quan to individuals if you are interested i can find the book at home and get the pertinent info now as for the position detector you might try eltec in florida phone number listed in the nine two nine three etid is nine zero four two five three five three two eight they seem like nice people their specialty is passive infrared detection devices so they might be able to help you out i m curious about your applications if you don t mind saying the device sounds like it could be useful in a lasertag game although you d need to up your carrier signal concept to five eight eight khz duane
