 from kolstad cae wisc edu joel kolstad subject re dumb question function generator organization u of wisconsin madison college of engineering lines three five in article dgj two y kelvin seas virginia edu david glen jacobowitz writes i have a new scope and i thought i d save a few bucks by buying one with a function generator built in hmm now where was that ad for the combination radio hand cranked generator flashlight siren i saw function generator has a five zero mv offset and the amplitude s too high is there any way i could make myself a little box that could solve this little problem the box would tkae the function generator input lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some low unchanging number i would want to lower the voltage by a factor of one hundred or so i could just build a little buffer amp but i d like to have this box not be active sure you ve already got the right idea ignoring the five zero ohm internal resistance of the generator for a second just run it into say a voltage divider made of nine nine zero ohms in series with one zero ohms this new circuit is the thevenin equivalent of one that puts out one one zero zero of the original voltage and has an output impedence of negligibly less than one zero ohms you may want to monkey with the values a little depending on whether you care more about the exact dividing ratio or the availability of parts hows that sound joel kolstad p s this is why those one zero zero zero one high voltage probes for multimeters can be accurate but still cheap they have something like one zero zero megs in series with one zero zero k which doesn t load the often high impedence source much as well as keeping the probably one zero meg impedance multimeter happy
