 from kolstad cae wisc edu joel kolstad subject re wanted a to d hardware for a pc article i d doug one nine nine three apr six zero five three seven three six two three one one three organization u of wisconsin madison college of engineering lines two two in brad wright writes if you know much about pc s ibm comp you might try the joystick port though i haven t tried this myself i ve been told that the port has built in a d converters this would allow the joystick to be a couple of pots if you could find the specs this might just work for you i believe that the a d converters found on a joystick port are really timers that tick off how long it takes an r c circuit the r being your paddle to charge up to something like one two vcc for games this works pretty well but you certainly wouldn t want to try to take lab measurements off something as non linear as that hmm i suppose you could linearize it in software but the real problem is that the precision of your measurement is no longer constant higher voltages would be more precise on the other hand i could be wrong and perhaps the game card designers splurged for the extra five zero to make a cheap constant current source out of an op amp but i wouldn t expect that joel kolstad
