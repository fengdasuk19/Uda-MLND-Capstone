 from kolstad cae wisc edu joel kolstad subject re how to the disks copy protected organization u of wisconsin madison college of engineering lines three eight in article sehari iastate edu babak sehari writes i have written a program and i want to market it i would like certain degree of protection since my main custmers are individuals and not the cooperations i know laser hole burning method and hardware key method however my software is going to cost only one five zero zero so i can not afford that also at this low price i can not afford people make too many copy of my software well i guess say upto two zero illigal copying is ok by me however i do not want someone to get a copy of pctools and copy my software off course i never meant to forbid the true hackers from copying since they can develope a better program anyway i wouldn t bother with the copy protection if i were you if you program is any good the pirates will have stripped the protection and will be distributing the stripped version is well under a week hardware methods prevent j random loser from using his copy ii pc to pirate your software but doesn t stop anyone who knows a few people with enough connections to real pirates who will be able to defeat your check for the hole code you may want to price your software depending on what it is a tad higher a price change from one five to two five probably would turn off very few potentials buyers and that way you could tolerate more pirates whose numbers don t change with the price as for the two zero pirating figure ha ha of course a lot of pirates just have this thing about having pirated software even if they never use it so perhaps that really wouldn t count towards two zero even so two zero is awfully low joel kolstad p s i assume you re talking pc software if you re talking unix hp four eight or something else somewhat obscure copy protection might be a slightly more viable alternative
