 from henry zoo toronto edu henry spencer subject re seven four act organization u of toronto zoology lines eight six in article mpaul unl edu marxhausen paul writes ok what s a quick rundown on all the seven four zero zero series variations we re repairing something with a seven four act zero zero on it and the question arises well do i really need the act part flipping through digi key i see als as c hc ac acq act hct acht hctls here s something i posted about this a few years ago it s not fully up to date with all the new variations some of which are just different manufacturer s synonyms in practical terms ignoring the technological details this is my view of the families nb i am not a giant corporation which influences my views on things like availability and backward compatibility seven four the original speed good power consumption fair effectively obsolete now use seven four ls or later except for a very few oddball functions like seven four zero seven which are hard to find in newer families seven four h modification of seven four for higher speed at the cost of higher power consumption very obsolete use seven four f seven four l modification of seven four for lower power at the cost of lower speed very obsolete use cmos seven four s later modification of seven four for even higher speed at some cost in power consumption effectively obsolete use seven four f seven four ls combination of seven four l and seven four s for speed comparable to seven four with lower power consumption best all round ttl now widest variety of devices seven four f fast as blazes power not too bad the clear choice for high speed in ttl availability and prices generally good seven four as failed competitor to seven four f although a few seven four as parts do things that are hard to find in seven four f and thus are still useful seven four als possible replacement for seven four ls generally souped up still fairly new availability and prices possibly a problem seven four c fairly old family cmos devices with ttl pinouts competed with four zero zero zero series not too successfully obsolete use four zero zero zero or newer cmos seven four families four zero zero zero thrown in as the major non seven four non ecl logic family the old cmos family still viable because of very wide range of devices low power consumption and wide range of supply voltages not fast very forgiving and easy to work with beware static electricity but that comment applies to many other modern logic families too there are neat devices in this family that exist in no other the clear choice when speed is not important seven four hc a new attempt at seven four pinout cmos fast compared to old cmos power consumption often lower than ttl possibly a good choice for general purpose logic assuming availability and affordability cmos logic levels not ttl ones beware very limited range of supply voltages compared to older cmos also major rise of power consumption at faster speeds seven four hct seven four hc with ttl logic levels much the same comments as seven four hc read the fine print on things like power consumption ttl compatibility in cmos involves some compromises one zero k thrown in for speed freaks the low end of ecl various sources claim that it is easier to work with than super fast ttl for serious high speed work less forgiving though read and follow the rules or it won t work availability to hobbyists limited can be expensive one zero zero k for real speed freaks hot ecl harder to handle than one zero k and inconvenient packages much more useful datasheets however as for compatibility between families the seven four families except seven four c and seven four hc are all more or less logic level compatible but how many seven four x devices you can drive from one seven four y output varies enormously with x and y you just have to read the specs and do the arithmetic seven four c and seven four hc are compatible with the others with a bit of hassle four zero zero zero compatibility can be a bit of hassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage four zero zero zero is using one zero k or one zero zero k to anything else is considerable hassle me i use four zero zero zero and seven four ls with a sprinkling of seven four f seven four hct and one zero k are interesting but i haven t used either significantly yet all work is one man s work henry spencer u of toronto zoology kipling henry zoo toronto edu utzoo henry
