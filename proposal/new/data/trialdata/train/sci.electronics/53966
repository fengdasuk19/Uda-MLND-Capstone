 from alan apple com alan mimms subject re uart needed really break detect organization apple computer inc lines two six in article jam ameslab gov jerry musselman wrote i need to find a uart that will interface to an eight zero five one and do the following two five zero k baud eight data bits two stop bits no parity ability to do break detect irq or output pin irq on character received i m using a dallas ds two two five zero at one six mhz eight zero five one clone but it won t do break detect i ve looked at the six eight five zero eight two five one seven two zero one two six six one etc any help would be appriciated actually detecting a break is done by watching for a character containing all zero bits with the framing error resulting from its receipt this means that the line stayed in the zero bit state even past the stop bit time slot which basically indicates a break there is no special way to detect break that i have found other than this there s no magic signal generated by uarts etc alan mimms alan apple com apple alan my opinions are generally portable macintosh software group pretty worthless but apple computer they are my own art without engineering is dreaming engineering without art is calculating steven k roberts in computing across america
