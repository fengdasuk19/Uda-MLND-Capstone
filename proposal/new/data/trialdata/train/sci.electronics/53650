 from peter m insane apana org au peter tryndoch subject swr meter for cb radios lines two eight allthe devil reincarnateswr meter for cb radios td from ssave ole cdac com the devil reincarnate td organization cdac wa td what td is a good choice for a cb one four or one eight wave td i read the installation instructions on a one four wave antenna td and they suggested that i use an swr to tune it at channel one two td and channel three two for a minimum reading question is why channel td one two and three two the best antenna is one that will let out the most wave probably not the best explanation but the rest makes sense a one wave will cancell itself out btw no such beastie the best is a one two wave antenna followed by one four then one eight etc as for swring in what you actually do is trim the antenna to the correct length for the specific wavelength you will be transmitting on since the wavelength varies with the channel you use then it s recommended to swr in using the middle channel of those you are going to use anyway in the beginning of cb s all new antennas had to be swr ed in nowdays manufactures trim the antennas almost spot on so that there s not much point in swring then again you may be a fanatic and whish to do it anyway cheers peter t
