 from ritley uimrl seven mrl uiuc edu subject seeking thermocouple amplifier circuit reply to ritley uiucmrl bitnet organization materials research lab lines one seven i would like to be able to amplify a voltage signal which is output from a thermocouple preferably by a factor of one zero zero or one zero zero zero so that the resulting voltage can be fed more easily into a personal computer based adc data acquisition card might anyone be able to point me to references to such circuits i have seen simple amplifier circuits before but i am not sure how well they work in practice in this case i d like something which will amplify sufficiently nicely to be used for thermocouples say a few degrees accuracy or better any pointers would be greatly appreciated
