 from m one four four nine four mwvm mitre org mike white subject re expen ive motorola handheld radio for peanuts nntp posting host smassimini mac mitre org organization the mitre corporation distribution na lines three zero agent x writes i can no longer use anything japanese kenwood yeasu icom alinco its all junk well i m not sure i d go quite that far but i agree that motorola gear is of better quality the question is how much that quality is worth to a ham in amateur service not commercial service this radio can hear a repeater thats four zero miles away without an antenna ok great but how often does that come up how good is good enough and how much is someone willing to pay for it a good ham quality ht is maybe five zero zero while a commercial quality one is maybe two zero zero zero is the increased reliability and performance worth four times the price in amateur service only the individual involved can answer that question and each ham has to decide for him herself if motorola quality is worth four times the price to you then more power to ya but i m amazed that folks make that choice for me given that i ve got two zero zero zero to spend i l pick the yaesu ht and a nice new hf rig every time over a motorola ht alone no matter how good it is to me ham quality gear is good enough to each his own seven three mike n four pdy these are my opinions only
