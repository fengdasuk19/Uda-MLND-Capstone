 from baseball catch the fever scd ucar edu gregg walters subject mathcad four zero swap file organization scientific computing divison ncar boulder co lines one one nine reposting and summarizing for your information or additional comment this is long i have one six mb of memory on my three eight six sx two five mhz an intel math coprocessor and a one two zero mb hard drive with two zero mb free no compression i have been running mathcad three one under windows three one in enhanced mode with a five mb ram drive two mb one mb smart drive and no swap file permanent or temporary for several months i am interested in the faster mathcad four zero but i am concerned about reported swap file requirements and the legitimacy of mathsoft s claim about increased speed to three eight six sx users will mathcad four zero run without a swap file or insist that i use a swap file so far in response to a less detailed description of my setup or in unrelated postings the more informed answers on the net or by e mail appear to be one by fuess llnl gov david a fuess according to mathsoft no mathcad uses the swap file extensively so as not to overburden the physical resources they say this is actually a win three two s feature a figure of one zero mb was indicated to me as a minimum but you might try anyway two by bert tyler satalink com bert tyler i m not all that certain that mathcad is the culprit here i have a four eight six six six dx two with one six mb of main memory less two mb for a ramdisk and a bit for a dos session that is opened as part of the startup process which i have been running without any swapfile when i installed the win three two s subsystem from the march beta of the nt sdk the win three two s subsystem itself demanded the presence of a swapfile the only win three two s program i ve run to date is the three two bit version of freecell that came with that subsystem i gave windows a small temporary swapfile i m leery of files that must remain in fixed locations on my hard disk and all seems well three by bca ece cmu edu brian c anderson what is win three two i upgraded to mathcad four zero and it installed a directory for win three two under windows system during the upgrade it told me that win three two was required four by case zero zero three zero student tc umn edu steven v case one mathcad four zero makes use of the win three two s libraries you ve probably heard about win three two s it is a three two bit windows library that provides much of the windows nt functionality no support for threads and multitasking and such but can be run under windows three one five by rhynetc zardoz chem appstate edu thomas c rhyne i also have one six mb of ram and indeed mathcad four zero insisted on a permanent swapfile it would not run otherwise six by bishop baeyer chem fsu edu greg bishop three mathcad absolutely requires four mb ram with one two mb swap file or eight mb ram with eight mb swap file it will give you a not enough memory error if the swap file is less than eight mb it is a major resource hog if you do not load the symbolic processor or the smart math it takes about five mb of ram real or virtual just to load again due to the win three two s libraries so it seems that in addition to the system requirements shown on mathsoft s advertisement for four zero that you need a swap file possibly as big as one two mb looks like i would just need an eight mb swap file and would need to choose or can i between a faster permanent swap file or a slower temporary swap file apparently a win three two subsystem ships with mathcad four zero how much disk space does this require i also received these answers one by mfdjh uxa ecn bgu edu dale hample if you ve got one six megs of ram why not configure one zero megs as a ram disk for mathcad dos six permits different bootup configurations can mathcad four zero win three two be configured to use such a ram drive instead of a swap file if not i don t see how using dos six zero for an alternate bootup would provide windows with this swap file some time back i remember a discussion about the issues of using a ram drive to support a swap file but i thought this involved slower presumeably you mean without a permanent swap file if windows needs a swap file it will upo and create one if a permanent one doesn t exist permanent is generally faster though i don t know why mathcad wouldn t be happy with either type ver three zero is and so should any program conforming to the win specification so far one six mb has been enough ram to avoid the overhead of running any swap file i have been running mathcad three one under windows three one without one
