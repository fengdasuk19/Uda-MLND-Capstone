 subject roman bmp zero one one four in response to the requests for cool bitmaps i am posting one from pwiseman salmon usd edu cliff reply to pwiseman salmon usd edu cliff distribution usa organization university of south dakota lines nine seven eight due to the resolution and size it is in one four parts this is a uuencoded bitmap nine six zero x six zero zero two five six colors the picture is a marbled gazebo on a desert with blue sky background the size is just right for centered wallpaper on a one zero two four x seven six eight display because it leaves a border at the bottom just big enough for icons to fit in without being on top of the picture reguarding image quality and resolution i have not seen much better for those of you who haven t worked with pieced image files here is how to put it back together one save the one four parts to one four individual files two use a text editor to remove the header and footer in each file three concatinate all the parts into a single file four uudecode the file there are tools available to do this without the hassle such as uuconvert unix and uucoder windows if neccesary i could post these tools or where to get them by ftp
