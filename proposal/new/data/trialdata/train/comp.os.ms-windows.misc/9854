 from jls atglab atg com jerome schneider reply to jls atg com distribution world subject re out of environment space running bat files from windows organization aspen technology group x mailer uupc bsnews two one modified lines four two i have a bat file that i run under a windows icon i have set up a pif file to run the bat file in exclusive mode and to use the entire screen the first line of the bat file sets an environment variable my problem is that on some of our machines running ms dos five zero and windows three one in enhanced mode the set command in the bat file fails with the out of environment space error i have raised the amount of environment space to two zero four eight bytes using the shell command in config sys so i know that i am nowhere near to running out from the windows resource toolkit for win four workgroups add an entry to your system ini file under the nonwindowsapp section commandenvsize nnnn this sets the command com env size where nnnn must either be zero or between one six zero and three two seven six eight a value of zero disables the setting if this value is too small or too big it is rounded up to one six zero or down to three two seven six eight if the value is less than the current size of the actual environment this setting is disabled as if it were zero if you specify the environment size in a pif file for command com the pif setting overrides this setting the default is zero with msdos versions earlier than three two otherwise the default value is the e option in the shell command in config sys to set this value you must edit your system ini and reboot i have used this entry as well as relied on the default e from the config sys shell line and both give larger environments if you don t use one of these then the environment passed by windows to each new dos box is just a little bit bigger than the environment variables present when windows was started no matter how big the dos env was when windows starts it truncates all unused space except for a few bytes this should allow your batch file to run but your mileage may vary jerome jerry schneider domain jls atg com aspen technology group uucp csn atglab jls po box six seven three ft collins co eight zero five two two voice three zero three four eight four one four eight eight
