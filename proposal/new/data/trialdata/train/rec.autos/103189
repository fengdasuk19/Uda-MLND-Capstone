 from jimf centerline com jim frost subject re best radar detector valentine one organization centerline software inc lines two six nntp posting host one four zero two three nine three two zero two troy sequent com troy wecker writes there is no question that the valentine one two nine nine has good range but not significant enough to be two or three times as expensive as some of the others the big win with the v one is not its range but rather its directionality and multiple transmitter tracking which you later called a gimmick a conclusion i disagree with since the detector incorporates multiple receivers it s not surprising that it s significantly more expensive while the added capabilities may not help you there is added value for those of us who live in areas where there are a lot of false alarms summary valentine one way too expensive and not a significantly better performer i certainly call it interesting but i m another person who thinks that the added value might be coming at too high a cost very adequate radar detectors are available for less than half the cost and one of them has suited me rather well if i did more long distance travelling in areas i m not familiar with i d probably consider getting the v one because it s additional information would be useful in discriminating false alarms jim frost jimf centerline com
