 from tedebear leland stanford edu theodore chen subject re plymouth sundance dodge shadow experiences organization dsg stanford university ca nine four three zero five usa distribution usa lines one nine in article raman translab its uci edu balaji v ramanathan writes the part about spending five zero zero zero seven zero zero zero on repairs reminds me of an article i read in a magazine comparing the five year ownership costs of a toyota camry and a ford taurus or something like that the result which they announced with great flourish was that it cost the same at the end of the period that was their argument to prove that you don t go wrong buying the ford taurus over the camry now if i remember correctly the camry costs about four zero zero zero or so more in initial costs essentially it means that you spend about four zero zero zero extra on repairs on the taurus that is ridiculous every time your car needs repairs it is extra hassles loss of time and a dozen other things i would much rather spend five zero zero zero more in initial costs than spend four zero zero zero more in repair costs did you account for depreciation i seriously doubt that a taurus would rack up an extra four zero zero zero in repair costs over five years teddy
