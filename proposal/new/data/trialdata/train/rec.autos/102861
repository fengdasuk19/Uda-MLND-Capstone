 from jimf centerline com jim frost subject re too fast article i d armory one qkon eight three re organization centerline software inc lines five six nntp posting host one four zero two three nine three two zero two wrat unisql uucp wharfie writes compare either to the porsche nine one one and you tell me which was designed oh right only one two zero zero zero zero dollar cars should be driven fast they drive goddamn rabbits at one two zero mph in europe pal and i reckon a taurus is at least as capable as a rabbit my whole point was not to say that the cars couldn t go that fast but that they shouldn t go that fast a family sedan designed to be operable at eight five mph doesn t suddenly become operable at one three zero mph because you added some plastic aero effects slightly wider tires and a much larger engine that s what the sho is a slightly modified family sedan with a powerful engine they didn t even bother improving the brakes the mustang is essentially the same deal as the sho a big power plant stuck in a mid size sedan with almost no other modifications i have real life experience with the mustang it handles like a brick except when you re invoking oversteer of course something i personally avoid doing on the highway and stopping power is inadequate even from eight zero mph lots of accelleration but the rest of the car is not up to par i picked the porsche example because they are designed with speed in mind it didn t have to be the nine one one it could have been the much cheaper nine four four or one of several mercedes or audi models all of these cars are fairly expensive but so are the parts that make them drivable at high speed this should be elementary there are a few things to keep in mind about europe since you brought it up my autobahn knowledge is admittedly second hand but i believe the following to be true one drivers are much better disciplined in europe than they are here two the roads comprising the autobahn are much better designed than they are here and usually include animal fences this makes them far more predictable than most us highways three not all of europe is the autobahn most places in europe have speed limits that aren t out of line with what we used to have in the us if my friends weren t lying to me they re typically not much higher than one two zero km h i strongly suspect you won t find a lot of rabbit owners doing one two zero mph nearly two zero zero km h on the autobahn but i could be wrong some people have no respect for their own lives you certainly haven t convinced me of course not speeding is bad speeding is illegal i will not speed i love big brother you had your mind made up already if you think so you sure don t pay attention to my postings jim frost jimf centerline com
