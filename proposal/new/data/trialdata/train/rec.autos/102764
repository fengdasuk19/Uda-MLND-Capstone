of one four april one nine nine three revised brake fluid section as non silicone dot five fluids are now apparently available rpw commonly asked automotive questions tire questions q what do the funny numbers on the sides of my tires mean a typically you will see something like one nine five six zero hr one four the one nine five is the overall width of the tire in millimeters the tread is usually narrower the six zero is the aspect ratio it indicates the height of the sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width our example tire has a sidewall height of zero six zero one nine five one one seven mm the one four is the wheel diameter in inches there are also some special tires called trx tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations like three nine zero which is in millimeters the r means radial and the h is a speed rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire when properly inflated and carrying an appropriate load may safely operate common speed ratings are s one one two mph t one one eight mph h one three zero mph and v up to one five zero mph recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed rating to a different part of the designation you may therefore find designations like one nine five six zero r one four eight five h the eight five indicates the per tire load associated with the speed rating exceeding this load in continuous operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice what follows is a table showing a number of load indices and corresponding maximum per tire loads load index five zero five one eight eight eight nine one one two one one three one four five one four nine one five seven max load kg one nine zero one nine five five six zero five eight zero one one two zero one one five zero two nine zero zero three two five zero four one two five note that the usual mass vs weight confusion occurs in this table in some cases the letters p or lt may be found in front of a tire size the lt designation indicates light truck and the p designation indicates passenger car if no letter is given then the application of the tire is passenger car usage as far as i know these letters only appear in the us market the lt designation is prinicipally of interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles for the owner of a passenger vehicle there is no meaningful difference between a tire with a p designation and one with no designation at all if the aspect ratio is omitted it is probably eight zero but may be seven eight tires with an ms mud snow designation may have their speed rating reduced by two zero km h about one two mph there is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature traction and treadwear temperature and traction are graded a b and c with a the best and c the worst treadwear is a numeric rating these values are of limited value as they are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires q my car has tires with a funny size designation one eight five six five hr three nine zero can i put normal tires on the car a your tires are called trx tires they were devised by michelin because of a somewhat different bead design they are incompatible with normal tires michelin used a different diameter wheel for them so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel and so that more conventional tires could not be mounted on trx type wheels you will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your car it is barely possible to fit normal tires on trx wheels and horribly dangerous to do so the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner or possibly blow out at high speed trx type tires are becoming hard to find in addition to michelin avon makes suitable tires goodyear has apparently discontinued their line of trx tires q can i rotate radials from side to side or rotate them only on one side of my car a car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject many say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a car is now ok this group includes michelin and goodyear others for example pirelli and nokia will void warranties if such swapping is done the best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before rotating your tires and stick to the manufacturer s recommendations q how many snow tires should i buy and if i buy two which end of the car should i put them on a in short four and both ends to explain many drivers in areas that don t get excessive snow or who don t drive agressively or at all in snow conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels but there are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice with a rear wheel drive car you can choose between being able to start the car going a function of the rear axle or stopping and turning the car a function of the front axle in a front wheel drive car you start stop and turn with the front end the primary risk of putting the snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes while going downhill you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards radar detectors and speed limits q why aren t there any comments on radar detectors and speed limits in this q good three point belts alone work much better than airbags alone and airbags three point belts work slightly better than three point belts alone the con to airbags is that some designs tend to burn the driver s hands when venting the byproducts of the explosion that occurs inside the bag and that some designs but not all may knock the driver s hands from the wheel making retention of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult brake questions q do i always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned midas always wants to do this a no there are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing rotors some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors more often than is strictly necessary if the rotors are not warped warped and only lightly grooved then there is no need to replace or to turn them note also that some rotors the rotors on many hondas are a good example are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical to turn them they must be replaced when they become too thin warped or badly grooved q they tell me i should downshift when braking to slow my car down is this really a good idea a it used to be a very good idea back in the days of mediocre fade prone drum brakes in modern disc brake equipped cars use of downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary except in cases of long steep downhill runs otherwise modern disc brakes are more than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances and they are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings on the other hand many standard driver s license tests in the usa still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking i suggest that before taking a us driver s test you either one learn to do this smoothly which takes some time and practice or two borrow a car with an automatic to take the test q how often should i replace my brake fluid a probably more often than you do traditional brake fluids tend to absorb water this water can corrode internal parts of the brake system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid dot three type are older fluids dot four and dot five are newer specifications the principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points the dry boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid but the wet boiling point is important in older brake fluid dot three fluids have the lowest wet and dry boiling point requirements dot four fluids have better boiling point requirements and dot five fluids have the best boiling point requirements but dot five fluids are not clearly superior see the next q some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the brake system when converting to silicone fluids two other issues that come up with silicone fluids one they are difficult to pour cleanly that is without air bubbles which interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel and two while they generally have much higher boiling points than dot four fluids they do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable in effect from boiling dot four fluids silicone fluids may make sense in some street car applications but they are certainly not recommended for high performance driving applications and the economics are questionable for street use i have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the dot five standard that do not contain silicones these fluids appear to be reasonably compatible with the older dot three and dot four fluids but i have little information at this time q abs is available on some of the cars i m looking at but it costs more is it worth it a this does not have a cut and dried answer therefore this answer will be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons the short answer is that abs costs more both initially and to maintain will generally work better for the average driver that is to say a driver who does not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques and may require the unlearning of some obsolete braking techniques like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case now for the long answer abs works by monitering the wheels of the car looking for signs of locked brakes it may or may not be able be able to distinguish between the different wheels there are several systems on the market it cannot detect impending lockup which is what you would really want in an ideal world but only the existence of lockup the sensors used vary some of the less well designed sensors are sensitive to tire size and to brake pad material and may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original equipment or oe equivalent components when the sensors detect lockup the abs system responds by unlocking the brakes either individually or all at once depending on the system if the driver keeps their foot firmly planted the abs will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states if a sensor existed that could detect impending lockup then we could sit right at that point which is where maximum braking effect is achieved this pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal as the system cycles the percentage of the time that the brakes are truly engaged is called the duty cycle typically in an abs system this is about four zero on dry pavement a trained driver can beat this duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking on wet pavement braking is so chancy that abs will outperform threshold braking nearly every time unfortunately on mud and on snow often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes locked only audi of the manufacturers producing abs equipped cars has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the abs system for this eventuality a particularly important feature of abs is that it preserves steering control this is the case simply because if you are braking near the limit and turn the wheel the abs will release the brakes if it sees steering triggered lockup and back off on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied braking distances will lengthen accordingly an important caution abs cannot exceed the maximum theoretical braking force in any given situation if you start sliding on glare ice don t expect an abs system to help you out very much the coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an abs system in your car as far as maintenence goes in addition to the potential restrictions i ve listed above you have to worry about the following one parts costs are much higher the oe master cylinder for my obscure european sedan lists for one eight five but the oe master cylinder for the abs equipped version of the same car lists for over one zero zero zero most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of dot five silicone brake fluids in abs equipped vehicles because of the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system components regular i suggest annual replacement of brake fluid becomes very important q what about this threshold braking business a normally i d not put this in the consumers q if made a habit it replaces the stab the pedal and lock em up panic habit entirely and is much to be prefered basically the premise is that tires generate maximum braking force when they have just started to slide but just before the wheels lock up entirely drivers who threshold brake learn to feel what this threshold feels like and learn to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake pedal in many cars you can feel that you are near the threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it in any case if you can t hear the tires whine just a bit you re not very near the threshold in a car with abs often there is a twinge in the pedal just before the system starts cycling if the driver backs off on the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt then they are very close to the threshold and they ll probably achieve better stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the abs take over recently there has been a rash of publicity over a number of accidents and one death involving police cars equipped with abs systems the police departments in question quickly blamed the new abs systems but according to autoweek magazine it now seems clear that the problem was a lack of training none of the involved officers had any recent performance driving training there is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing brake pedal by pump braking an old and discredited technique of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal the goal being to try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system if you think about it for a minute you ll realize that pump braking must cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least one two so if you cut the four zero duty cycle of an abs system by that much you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective and useful technique regardless of whether your car has abs if you do fear a failed hydraulic system then one or two stabs at the pedal will be sufficient gas questions q does high octane gasoline help a maybe maybe not some cars have knock sensors and can adjust the engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used on most cars however you should use the cheapest gas that makes your car run well check your owner s manual for details on what your car needs q my car was made for leaded gasoline will unleaded gas hurt it a it is possible that unleaded gas may slightly increase valve wear although the amoco oil company argues otherwise the actual increase in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable however as modern leaded gasolines actually contain very little lead you should however check your owner s manual many cars from the early one nine seven zero s do not actually require leaded gasoline q do fuel treatments help what kind should i use a some do and some don t during the winter it is a good idea to use dry gas however some may be harmful to fuel injection systems never use an additive containing methanol sometimes called methyl alcohol such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection manufacturer s opinions vary on additives containing ethanol sometimes called ethyl alcohol if your car has fuel injection check the owner s manual on your car before using these most manufacturers consider one zero ethanol acceptable in gasoline additives with isopropyl alcohol isopropanol and petroleum distillates are fine in fuel injected cars an occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with fuel injectors although many premium gasolines contain detergents that do the same job some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain ethanol or methanol always check the ingredients before putting anything in your gas tank there are a small number of particularly good additives these are noticeably more expensive that the run of the mill ones but work much much better among these are chevron techron redline sl one wurth lubrimoly ventil sauber and bg four four k a bottle of one of these once every six months is highly recommended q what about detergent gasolines a the quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat bmw has instituted a testing program and gasoline brands which pass this test may advertise that fact stickers indicating passage of the test are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations if such gasolines are used then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional beforewarned that while use of bmw approved gasolines will keep a clean engine clean they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits lubrication questions q what do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean a there are several different items encoded there is a two letter code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer uses in the oil this looks like se sf cd or such the s codes are for gasoline engine applications the c codes are for diesel engine applications the second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels of protection are developed thus sf is considered better than se se is considered better than sd and so forth the more noticeable designation is the oil weight this is either a single number e g three zero weight or a pair of numbers separated by the letter w e g one zero w three zero the latter type is much more commonly used these days and are the only type that most automobile manufacturers specify in operators manuals the first number in the designation one zero w is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold the w stands for winter the second number three zero is the viscosity of the oil when hot there is a trick here the oil doesn t actually get thicker turn from one zero weight to three zero weight as it gets hotter what is actually happening is that when the oil is cold it has the viscosity of a cold one zero weight oil as it gets hotter it doesn t get thin as fast as a one zero w oil would by the time it is up to temperature it has the viscosity of a hot three zero weight oil note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities not all one zero w oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold and not all three zero weight oils have the same viscosity when hot note also that the novel behaviour of multi grade oils is caused by additives and it has been reported that with the sole exception of castrol gtx one zero w four zero oils do not retain their multi grade characteristics well over time one zero w three zero one five w four zero and two zero w five zero oils work very well though q are quick lube places any good a some do adequate work but there are quite a few incompetent ones out there let the buyer beware watch them while they work make sure that they don t overtorque the oil drain plug and keep your hand on your wallet at all times q are oil additives like slick five zero or tufoil any good a slick five zero and tufoil are ptfe based additives many of these have come onto the market recently they are different from the moly based additives that have been around since the early five zero s ptfe is the chemical name for teflon tm a trademark owned by dupont in general auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products most usenet responses to questions on these additives are favorable slight increase of mpg after application smoother revving but long term results whether ptfe additives are effective after five k miles are debatable some manufacturers such as saab claim that either the product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage some bmw owners have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of slick five zero to their cars this writer has been cautioned by a slick five zero dealer that slick five zero should not be used in japanese motors as it may clog the oil return passages in the engine otherwise there are no known reports of damage caused by ptfe additives on the other hand there are satified slick five zero customers in the world q do synthetic oils really work a yes but more specifically most auto manufactuers accept synthetics but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by oil manufacturers auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your car even if you decide to try the longer intervals at least change the oil filter at regular intervals as synthetics get just as dirty as conventional oils synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter entirely amsoil redline and agip are very highly regarded and very effective mobil one synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews however q manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals how often should i change my oil a it depends on how you drive if your car always or nearly always gets warmed up and you don t drive it very hard and keep the revs down the manufacturer s recommendation is probably fine if however you drive it hard drive it at high revs or alternatively if you only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn t get up to temperature then you may wish to change oil much more often perhaps at three zero zero zero mile intervals given that most manufacturers are now specifying seven five zero zero mile intervals if you don t drive your car much at all say seven five zero zero miles a year then you probably want to change oil every six months anyway if you are storing a car during the winter then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out of storage misc questions q my car has a timing belt i hear that bad things happen when they break what s the story a it depends on the internal design of the motor early ford escorts for example will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks but the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt some honda motors will not be damaged but others will be if no replacement interval is specified for your car then change the belt at least every six zero zero zero zero miles some cars may require more frequent replacement ask your dealer or independent mechanic also ask if there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time for example the same ford escorts that suffer valve damage also have a timing belt driven water pump which has been known to seize destroying the timing belt and which then causes major valve damage as a side effect replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water pump can be a costly mistake q why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it self destructs when the timing belt breaks a for performance reasons compromising piston design so that the valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression ratio of the engine be reduced significantly this is why you are more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance oriented vehicles q what causes unintended acceleration a the final report of the national highway transportation and safety administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the same time be consistent with the physical evidence the nhtsa report goes on to conclude that pedal misapplication by the vehicle operator is probably the cause richard welty five
