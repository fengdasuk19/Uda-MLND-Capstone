 from jahonen cc lut fi jarmo ahonen subject re what is volvo nntp posting host cc lut fi organization lappeenranta university of technology finland lines six four boyle bbsls two three bnr ian boyle writes seven four zero turbo in uk was good for one two four mph useful for blowing away vw beetles though i believe the beetle corners better i can say without any doubt that i have never been blown away by any volvo ever i ve been blocked into a few car parks though by shit head volvo owners who only thought they d be a few minutes this does not happen with the owners of any other makes of car not sure how long the small shit box volvos last too damn long the worst car i ever drove was a hired three four zero in power handling and ride it was reminiscent of something from the five zero s without the character the three four zero only ceased production a couple of years back i ve only been a passenger in the big volvos but that was enough i ought to go for a test drive because they offer some neat gifts oh well i have to admit that the most disgusting feature of volvo s is their marketing it looks like volvo uses something like do you dare to risk your family in any car attitude which is quite annoying in the long run but now volvo has produced a new good car the volvo eight five zero front drive two four l two zero valves motor completely new chassis etc even the british magazine car liked it and believe me that is quite much for a volvo and the american magazine road track said that this is not your uncle olof s car and in a positive sense but in any case i d still like to own the nine six zero estate strong tank like chassis three zero l inline six rear drive btw the only car drivers who have blocked me are land rover or jaguar drivers what you mean what i drive a cheapo japanese a toyota of course i do not have money for a car like bmw merc jaguar saab nine zero zero zero volvo eight five zero or nine six zero etc if i had the money i would have bad problems deciding which one to buy
