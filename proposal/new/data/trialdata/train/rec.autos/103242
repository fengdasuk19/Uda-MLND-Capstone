 organization central michigan university from john foster subject re changing oil by self lines three eight from drew kinglear cs colorado edu drew eckhardt in article pod sour sw oz au paul o donnell wri in yiklam unixg ubc ca yik chong lam writes hello does anyone know how to take out the bolt under the engine compartment should i turn clockwise or counter i tried any kind of lubricants wd four zero etc but i still failed do you think i can use a electric drill change to a suitable bit to turn it out if i can succeed can i re tighten it not too tight is it safe without oil leak you shouldn t need any power tools to undo it an electric drill probably won t give you much extra torque anyway wd four zero will help things that are seized due to rust but this is unlikely for a drain plug you should be able to undo it with a spanner when it loosens it will probably become very loose and you will bash your knuckles on the underside of the car this is the price you must pay for doing you own work no that s the price you pay for not knowing how to use a wrench you want to pull the wrench towards you away from painful knuckle splitting hard things if you can t pull it because things are in the way push it with an open hand i find this method much better myself too although i do really hate it when the bolt finally comes loose and the wrench and my hand both come crashing into my face after coming to which is about one five minutes later i change my clothes because by this time all the oil has drained on me and ice my entire face and suck down about two zero tylenol to ease the pain later in the day i then proceed with refilling the engine oil it s just crazy how i try and change the oil on my cars in one weekend i go through about three bottles of tylenol and two bags of ice john
