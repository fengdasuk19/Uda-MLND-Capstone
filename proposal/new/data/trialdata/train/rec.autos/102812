and all he s ever gonna have will munny unforgiven six one i am beyond the under two five age group but i have an experience a few years ago that might be interesting to you i owned a one nine eight five toyota celica gt i decided to buy myself a gift a more exotic car front runners included the toyota supra turbo and the porsche nine two four one nine eight seven model years i narrowed it down to those two i liked the simplicity and handling and snob appeal too of driving a porsche the supra turbo was less money and had more features and performance almost a personal luxury car it had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the nine two four i was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the nine two four but i decided to stop by my insurance agent s office on the way i asked about what would happen to my rate with either car if you buy the supra your rate classification will be the same as the celica the eight five celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars with a slight increase because the car will be two years newer our lower risk division will continue to handle your account if you buy the porsche nine two four we ll have to change you to the standard higher rate company and your rate will double and if you go with a nine four four it s another story again we ll cover the rest of this year but cancel you after that but the supra is much faster than the nine two four and the nine two four is actually faster than the standard nine four four that doens t make sense that s what the book says we don t insure corvettes either for some reason the underwriters consider supras and their drivers as very traditional and conservative i eventually went with the supra for a number of reasons the porsche dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested but a tough high pressure guy in the back room at equal monthly payments it would have taken a year longer to pay for the porsche plus its higher insurance i concluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto theft everyone s entitled to my opinion goldberg oasys dt navy mil imagination is more important than knowledge albert einstein three two i live in idaho when i was two zero zero zero year what a bargain two eight let s see i m two four single male clean driving record i have a nine two vw corrado vr six i live

one two zero zero full cover reasonable liability no tickets no violations no accidents knock on wood mass one thing that makes a huge difference in mass is the town you live in i m personally in one of the best towns within reasonable distance of boston if i moved to the absolute best it would go down to about one one five zero if i moved to the worst it would be two zero zero zero also one accident and a couple of tickets would probably add another six zero zero rv four three i have a one nine nine zero mitsubishi eclipse turbo awd am two three years old and have no tickets that went on my record i live in illinois just outside of chicago and pay one five six zero a year with full coverage at state farm i did get a small discount because of my alarm system three zero a year i only live one five miles from chicago but if i actually lived in the city the price would be about two zero zero zero a year four one i m over two five but in case you re interested anyway i m insuring a nine three sho for two eight seven six month thats one zero zero k personal three zero zero k total one zero zero k property with two five zero deductible glass and towing state farm three nine unless you are under two zero or have been driving for less than five years i think you are being seriously ripped off i don t have one of the performance cars you listed but if your record is clean then you should not be paying over two k did you try calling all the insurance dealers you could find although rates are supposed to be standardized i ve found that most places i initially call give me some ridiculously high quote and finaly i hit one that is much lower also i have changed insurance companies when the rate went up at renewal no accidents tickets car gets older to maintain a low rate you always have to be careful when it comes to insurance companies eight good luck serge
