 from schludermann sscvx one ssc gov subject rfi art of clutchless shifting lines one eight nntp posting host sscvx one organization superconducting super collider laboratory i m wondering if anybody else out there is a clutchless shifter i ve been doing it my self over two zero zero zero zero zero miles on my current toyota truck i ve got over one five zero k i ve heard people talk about how doing this can damage a transmission my experiences suggest otherwise what techniques do you use on some old pieces of junk i drove the transmission was so worn that pumping the clutch was the only way to shift except clutchless to date i ve driven rabbits datsuns comets fords a chevy some where harder than others to shift but generally the higher the milage the smoother quicker easier they where to shift my technique is to ease back off the throttle and at the same time gently wrist back on the shift lever if for some reason i miss the shift window i lightly press the accelerator try agian i ve found that clutchless shifting is eaiser quicker at high rpms four zero zero zero seven zero zero zero i also skip gears some times using one three five one two four five krispy
