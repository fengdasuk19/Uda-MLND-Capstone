 from gwm spl one spl loral com gary w mahan subject re it s a rush was re too fast organization loral software productivity laboratory lines one two why should a good driver be terrified at one three zero mph the only thing i fear going at one three zero are drivers who switch to the left lane without using either rear view mirror or flashers doing one three zero to one five zero ain t a rush for me but it s fun and i get where i want to go much faster in defense of the drivers who are in the right lane here in the states people simply do not expect when they are driving to be overtaken at a speed differential of five zero mph i don t think this is because they are stupid of course there are exceptions they are just programmed because of the five five mph limit do you in the states when you look in the rear view always calculate future positions of cars based on a five zero speed differential dont get me wrong i love to drive in the left lane fast but when i overtake cars who are on the right i slow down a tad bit if i were to rely on the judgement of the other car to recognize the speed differential i would be the stupid one btw if no one else is around then go for it
