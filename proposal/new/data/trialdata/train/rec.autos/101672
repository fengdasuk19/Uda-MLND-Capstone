 from dwjz bnr ca doug zolmer subject re eight zero svx oil change nntp posting host bcarh two eight f reply to dwjz bnr ca doug zolmer organization bell northern research ltd distribution na lines two four in article swdwan napier uwaterloo ca donald wan writes my friend brought a subaru svx recently i had drove it for couples times and i think its a great car esp on snow however when she took it to a local subaru dealer for a oil change the bill came out to be about eight zero dollars the dealer told us it is because to change the oil filter on a svx it is necessary to disassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour at first we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in toronto but found out the they are charging roughly the same price so is there any svx owner out there that has the same problem and if the oil change story is true then the engineer of subaru looks pretty stubid to me by the way the car looks great labour prices for car service are very expensive in toronto compared to other parts of ontario for example there are places in ottawa that still charge only four zero hour i ve seen a couple of places charging six zero hour the cheapest i ve heard in toronto is seven zero hour swd wan doug zolmer internet dwjz bnr ca disclaimer my opinions only bell northern research ltd ottawa ontario canada conform moooo
