 from charlesw sail labs tek com charles wilson subject re experience opinions sought diesel engines article i d sail one three six zero zero organization tektronix inc beaverton or lines four two in article jkg jmp com writes apologies if this is a faq is there a faq posting for this group i am an infrequent reader of rec autos so i can t remember i am in the market for a used chevy suburban and have observed that prices for models with diesel engines run about one zero zero zero two zero zero zero less than comparable models with a gas engine there has to be a reason for this yes there is consumer confusion in the early eight zero s with the fuel crisis etc everyone wanted better fuel mileage diesel fuel was the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage than comparable gasoline engines so gm decided to conver their three five zero gas engine into a diesel engine i think was a five seven liter big mistake the engine was not redesigned but converted the engine could not handle the higher compression etc lots of problems with these cars this thew up a big red flag to the casual observer don t buy a diesel they are bad this was a gross generalization ask yourself this question if your livelihood depended on driving lots of it would you use a dependable or undependable but cheaper in the short run vehicle what do greyhound busses have in them trailer trucks even train locomotives are these gasoline engines no they are diesel tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a five zero zero zero zero zero mile warrantee with they vehicles i own an eight two diesel suburban the six two l diesel is a great engine just keeps going it was more expensive when new than the gasoline engine vehicle was the only problem with diesel engines is that when they need to be rebuilt they are expensive in a gas three five zero engine you will pay about one zero zero zero for a rebuild diesel six two l is about two zero zero zero but then again the diesel engine lasts about twice as long and gets about five zero better mileage a carburator for a gasoline engine costs about one zero zero to rebuild or less a rebuild of the fuel injection pump on a diesel will cost about five zero zero or more but then again you never need a tune up if you re looking at a rebuilt six two l i d say you got a great deal check to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also good luck
