 from bbenson sscvx one ssc gov subject re mazda just does not feel right lines two four nntp posting host sscvx one organization superconducting super collider laboratory in article mxm one zero zero three s one five msi umn edu ram v mohan writes i ve a eight nine mazda three two three with about four two zero zero zero miles on it recently i do not get a good feeling of the road esp on a wet pavement when driving the car it feels as if the car is wandering and there is no grip on the road the tires are the original ones and have threads on them passes the penny head test i had the shocks and struts and alignment checked and things are fine however i feel like that i dont have the grip of the road and feel as if the car is wandering esp on turns any help in this is appreciated thanks two shots at it one check the tires again if you can see the wear bars you re down to problem area and some tires pass a penny test between the bars that s no guide at all your problem in the wet is call hydroplaning you may not have enough tread left to channel water out from under the tire so it goes fishy on you as it lifts off the road two tires age in particular soft tire compounds get harder as you put them thru more heat cycles harder compounds don t grip as well as soft ones effect is very noticable on tires that get very hot very often such as in competition but it hits all tires bob benson
