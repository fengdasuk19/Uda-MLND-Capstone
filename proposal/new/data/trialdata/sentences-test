 from simon giaeb cc monash edu au subject virtues of purity modesty and innocence organization monash university melb australia lines one five four heres a nice story to help explain the virtues of purity innocence and modesty and their importance the most beautiful virtues this story is an excerpt taken from the basket of flowers by johann christoph von schmid in a certain little market town over a hundred years ago there lived an upright and intelligent man named jacob rede he was married to a most virtuous young woman and they lived happily in a humble home which was in the midst of a large beautiful val ley after living many happy years together jacob s wife died leaving him alone with only one friend his daughter mary even as a child mary was uncommonly pretty but as she grew in years her piety her innocence her modesty and her unfeigned kindne ss towards all she came in contact with gave to her beauty a rare and peculiar charm her face was lighted up with a look of such indescribable goodness that it seemed almost as though one looked upon an angel mary s greatest delight was the beautiful garden and her favour ite flowers were the violet the lily and the rose jacob loved to point to them as emblems of the virtues most becoming to her gender when she once early in march brought the first violet to him and joyfully called upon him to admire it he said let the modest violet my dear mary be to you an image of humil ity and of the benevolence that does good in secret it clothes itself in the tender colours of modesty it prefers to bloom in retired grots it fills the air with its fragrance while remain ing hidden beneath the leaves may you also my dear mary be like the retiring violet avoiding vain display not seeking to attract the public eye but preferring ever to do good in quietude and peace one morning when the roses and lilies were in full bloom and the garden appeared in its richest array jacob said to his daughter as he pointed out a beautiful lily which was beaming in the morning sun let the lily my dear child be to you the emblem of purity look how beautiful how pure and fair it is the whi test linen is as nothing compared with the purity of its petals they are like the snow happy the maiden whose heart is as pure and as free from stain but the purest of all colours is also the hardest five to preserve pure easily is the petal of the lily soiled touch it but carelessly or roughly and a stain is left behind in the same way a word or a thought may stain the purity of innocence then pointing to a rose he said let the rose my dear mary be to you an emblem of modesty more beautiful than the colour of the rose is the blush that rises to the cheek of a modest girl it is a sign that she is still pure of heart and innocent in thought happy is the maiden whom the suggestion of a thought that is indelicate will cause to blush as she is thus put on her guard against the approach of danger the cheeks which readily blush will remain for a long time with their roseate hue while those which fail to blush at the least indelicacy of thought will soon become pale and wan and go before their time to the grave among the many fruit trees that adorned the garden there was one that was prized above all the others it was an apple tree not much larger than a rose bush and stood by itself in the middle of the garden mary s father had planted it the day that she was born and every year it bore a number of beautiful apples once it blossomed earlier than usual and with unusual luxuriance the tree was one mass of blossom mary was so delighted with it that she went every morning as soon as she was dressed to look at it once when it was in full bloom she called to her father and said look father how beautiful was there ever such a lovely mingling of red and white the whole tree looks like one huge bunch of flowers the next morning she hastened into the garden to feast her eyes once more upon the tree but what was her grief to see that the frost had nipped it and destroyed all its flowers they were all become brown and yellow and when the sun came forth in its strength they withered and fell to the ground mary wept bitter tears at the sight then said the father thus does sinful pleasure destroy the bloom of youth oh my child never cease to remember how dreadful it is to be seduced from the path of right behold in the example of the apple tree an image of what would happen if you were to wander from the way if the hopes your conduct hitherto has raised in my heart should vanish not merely for a day or year but for life ah then how much more bitter would be the tears which i would shed over your lapse from virtue than those which now course down your cheeks life would have no joys for me with tears in my eyes i should six go down sorrowfully to my grave as he spoke the tears stood in his eyes mary was deeply moved and the words he uttered made so profound an impression upon her mind that she never forgot them under the eyes of a father so loving and wise and amid the flowers of her garden mary grew daily in stature and intelli gence blooming as a rose pure as a lily and retiring as a violet and as full of promise as a tree laden with blossom happy was the old man at all times to behold how plenteously the fruits of his garden rewarded his diligent toil but with how much more happiness and content did he mark the gracious effect produced upon the heart and mind of his beloved daughter by his pious teaching and example jacob plucked several roses and lilies tied them together in a bunch and gave them to mary with the words the lily and the rose sister flowers as they are belong the one to the other both incomparable in their beauty they are ren dered still more lovely by being together in the same way my dear child are innocence and modesty twin sisters of virtue and cannot be separated the greatest and most powerful guardian of purity is the thought of the

kingdom which can be a punishement in disguise if there is later apostacy romans one zero one six one seven but not all the israelites accepted the good news for isaiah says lord who has believed our message consequently faith comes from hearing the message and the message is heard through the word of christ so then we receive god s gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the gospel faith is a possible response to hearing god s word preached kids are not yet spiritually intellectually or emotionally mature enough to respond to god s word hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot be raised in baptism to a new life do you teach a child to pray the lord s prayer do you expect them to not steal they can have faith appropriate to their condition and in the new covenant we shall no longer say know the lord for they shall all know him from the least unto the greatest heb eight one one if you read all of ezekiel one eight you will see that god doesn t hold us guilty for anyone else s sins so we can have no original guilt from adam but also according to ezekiel one eight god will not hold innocent anyone on the basis of anyone elses innocense thus jesus could not be our federal head any more than adam if that s what ezekiel is talking about shall you make ezekiel one eight contradict the second commandemnt as well ezekiel one eight three one three two rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committted and get a new heart and a new spirit why will you die o house of israel for i take no pleasure in the death of anyone declares the sovereign lord repent and live the way to please god is to repent and get a new heart and spirit kids cannot do this acts two three eight three nine says that when we repent and are baptized we will then receive a new spirit the holy spirit then we shall live ezekiel three six two five two six indicates that this new heart will be given by god in the context of the sprinkling of water in baptism it is the action of god puting them into his new order and not a question of personal faith as such romans five one two therefore just as sin entered the world through one man and death through sin and in this way death came to all men because all sinned sin and death entered the world when the first man sinned death came to each man because each man sinned note that it s good to read through all of romans five one two two one some of the verses are easier to misunderstand than others but if we read them in context we will see that they are all saying basically the same thing let s look at one such but the death that came to all because of sin is not just their personal death but the dead state originbal sin we are in a covenant of death because adam our federal head gave over his dominion to the devil and death psalm five one five surely i was sinful at birth sinful from the time my mother conceived me this whole psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble ourselves before god in repentance for sinning david himself was a man after god s own heart and wrote the psalm after committing adultry with bathsheba and murdering her husband all that david is saying here is that he can t remember a time when he wasn t sinful he is humbling himself before god by confessing his sinfulness his saying that he was sinful at birth is a hyperbole the bible being inspired by god isn t limited to a literal interpetation but also uses figures of speech as did jesus john one six two five for another example of hyperbole see luke one four two six while this psalm is figurative in it s language it is not hyperbolic and the one does not necessarily imply the other there is not other hyperbolic language in this psalm what v five is likely refering to is what is symbolized by the ot cleanliness laws which make intercourse and childbrith both acts which caus uncleannes and seperation from god the whole psalm is in the language of ot ritual hyssop cleansing burnt offering etc david s sin with bathsheba included this element as he did not ritually cleanse himself when he should have but what was symbolized by the ot ritual was the truth that sin was passed generationally that s why the organ of generation had to be cut that s why brith was unclean uncleanness was death and all babies were born dead and needed to be washed to newness of life which we have in baptism today paul

 from rexlex fnal fnal gov subject arsenokoitai two bailey boswell organization fnal ad net lines one eight four continuing with dr deyoung s article survey of new interpretations of arsenokoitai d s bailey d s bailey was perhaps the trailblazer of new assessments of the meaning of arsenokoitai he takes the term in i cor six nine as denoting males who actively engage in homosexual acts in contrast to malakoi effeminate those who engage passively in such acts four however he insists that paul knew nothing of inversion as an inherited trait or an inherent condition due to psychological or glandular causes and consequently regards all homosexual practice as evidence of perversion three eight hence bailey limits the term s reference in paul s works to acts alone and laments modern translations of the term as homosexuals bailey wants to distinguish between the homosexual condition which is morally neutral and homosexual practices italics in source paul is precise in his terminology and moffatt s translation sodomites best represents paul s meaning in bailey s judgment three nine bailey clearly denies that the homosexual condition was known by biblical writers j boswell the most influential study of arsenokoitai among contemporary authors is that of john boswell five whereas the usual translation six of this term gives it either explicitly or implicitly an active sense boswell gives it a passive sense in an extended discussion of the term three four one five three he cites linguistic evidence and common sense to support his conclusion that the word means male sexual agents i e active male prostitutes his argument is that the arseno part of the word is adjectival not the object of the koitai which refers to base sexual activity hence the term according to boswell designates a male sexual person or male prostitute he acknowledges however that most interpret the composite term as active meaning those who sleep with make their bed with men boswell bases his interpretation on linguistics and the historical setting he argues that in some compounds such as paidomathes child learner the paido is the subject of manthano and in others such as paidoporos through which a child passes the paido is neither subject nor object but simply a modifier without verbal significance his point is that each compound must be individually analyzed for its meaning more directly he maintains that compounds with the attic form arreno employ it objectively while those with the hellenistic arseno use it as an adjective three four three yet he admits exceptions to this distinction regarding arreno boswell next appeals to the latin of the time namely drauci or exoleti these were male prostitutes having men or women as their objects the greek arsenokoitai is the equivalent of the latin drauci the corresponding passive would be parakoitai one who lies beside boswell affirms he claims that arsenokoitai was the most explicit word available to paul for a male prostitute since by paul s time the attic words pornos fornicator and porneuon one committing fornication found also in the lxx had been adopted to refer to men who resorted to female prostitutes or simply committed fornication seven in the absence of the term from pagan writers such as herodotus plato aristotle and plutarch and from the jewish writers philo and josephus boswell finds even more convincing evidence for his affirmation that arsenokoitai did not connote homosexual or even sodomite in the time of paul three four six eight he also demonstrates its absence in pseudo lucian sextus empiricus and libanius he subsequently finds it lacking in all discussions of homosexual relation three four six nine among christian sources in greek including the didache tatian justin martyr eusebius one zero clement of alexandria gregory of nyssa and john chrysostom chrysostom is singled out for his omission as final proof that the word could not mean homosexuality one one boswell next appeals to the omission of the texts of i cor and i tim from discussions of homosexuality among latin church fathers three four eight one two cited are tertullian arnobius lactantius and augustine the last named uses circumlocutions other latin writers include ausonius cyprian and minucius felix the term is also lacking in state and in church legislation by the sixth century the term became confused and was applied to a variety of sexual activities from child molesting to anal intercourse between a husband and wife three five three having surveyed the sources boswell concludes there is no reason to believe that either arsenokoitai or malakoi connoted homosexuality in the time of paul or for centuries thereafter and every reason to suppose that whatever they came to mean they were not determinative of christian opinion on the morality of homosexual acts three five three it is clear throughout that boswell defines arsenokoitai to refer to male prostitutes he even goes so far as to conclude that paul would probably not disapprove of gay inclination gay relationships enduring love between persons of the same gender or same sex eroticism one one two one six six one

 from mls panix com michael siemon subject eros in lxx concluding lexicographic note organization panix public access unix nyc lines five eight this might be better directed to s r c bible study which i have begun reading but since my earlier notes were posted to this forum i will conclude here as well a week ago i managed to find time to consult a septuagint concordance and a lxx text with apparatus at the library and i can now usefully conclude my look at the greek words for love as used in the christian background of the septuagintal translation of the jewish scriptures the principal result is that there is a cluster of uses of the verbal noun from erao eraste s meaning lover this cluster occurs just where one might most expect it in the propethic image and accusation of israel as faithless spouse to yhwh the verses in question are hosea two five seven jeremiah four three zero two two two zero lamentations one one nine and ezekiel one six three three three six lamentations is dependent on though not likely written by jeremiah the erotic meaning in its allegorical use not at all literally is evident so too in english unless you complement it with a phrase like of the arts the word lover is going to have an overtone of sexual relationship there is no surprise here but it is worthwhile to see that standard greek usage does show up in the translations from the hebrew more interestingly and some confirmation of my guess that later koine usage avoided the verb erao because of its homonymy to ero say eromai ask there is an error in codex vaticanus normally a very valuable witness where a form of erao is used in a completely absurd context two samuel two zero one eight where the meaning must be say in addition to the above and the uses i have already mentioned in proverbs esther two one seven uses the verb in its most natural application kai e rasthe ho basileus esthe r and the king loved esther and rather more interestingly one samuel one nine two supplies a modest degree of support to the gay appraisal of the relationship of david and jonathan kai io nathan huios saoul e ireito ton dauid sphodra and jonathan saul s son loved david intensely i m using the bracketed i for io ta subscript which i don t yet have a reasonable ascii convention for the relevance of this to the gay issue is not anything implicit about the historical facts but just that a quasi official translation of the hebrew text in the hellenistic period makes no bones about using the erotic verb in this context given the quite general usage of agapao for erotic senses this need not mean anything more than agapao alone would mean but it does disambiguate the relationship as far as this translator goes michael l siemon i say you are gods sons of the mls panix com most high all of you nevertheless or you shall die like men and fall mls ulysses att com like any prince psalm eight two six seven

interesting i have posted it to hear what other people feel about the issue i realise it is rather long one two pages in wordperfect by may well be worth the read except for the first page which i typed the rest was scanned inusing omnipage some of the f s have come out as t s and visa versa i have tried to correct as much as possible about the author peter hammond is the founder of frontline fellowship a missionary organisation witnessing to the communist countries in southern africa he has also made several visits to many east european countries frontline fellowship news issn one zero one eight one four four x praying for justice by peter hammond to those involved in ministering to christians suffering persecution the imprecatory psalms are a tremendous source of comfort and those of us who are fighting for the right to life of the preborn or battling social evils such as pornography or crime are beginning to appreciate what an important weapon god has entrusted to us in the imprecatory psalms the imprecatory psalms early in my christian walk i encountered the prayers for judgement in the psalms and was quite at loss to know how to respond to them prayers such as break the arm of the wicked and evil men call him to account for his wickedness psalm one zero one five did not seem consistent with the gospel of love which i had accepted yet psalm one zero one five was clearly motivated by love for god the lord is king for ever and ever the nation will perish from his land one zero one six and why does the wicked man revile god one zero one three and by love for the innocent who suffer you hear o lord the desire of the afflicted you encourage them and you listen to their cry defending the fatherless and oppressed in order that man who is of the earth may terrify no more one zero one seven one eight nevertheless i grew increasingly uncomfortable reading such graphic prayers for god to judge the wicked as pour out your wrath on them let your fierce anger overtake them six four two four o lord the god avenges o god who avenges shine forth rise up o judge of the earth pay back to the proud what they deserve nine five one two break the teeth in their mouths o god let them vanish like water let their arrows be blunted the righteous will be glad when they are avenged when they bathe their feet in the blood of the wicked then men will way surely the righteous still are rewarded surely there is a god who judges the earth five eight six one one certainly i wanted god to be honoured and yes i was deeply destressed by the prevalence of evil but could i actually pray for god to pour out his wrath on the wicked the scripture make it clear that these prayers are not to be prayed for own selfish motives nor against our personal enemies rather they are to be prayed in christ for his glory and against his enemies the psalmist describes the targets of these imprecation as those who devise injustice in their heart and whose hands mete out violence five eight two those who boast of evil and are a disgrace in the eyes of god your tongue plots destruction it is like a sharpened razor and you who practise deceit you love evil rather than good falsehood rather than speaking the truth five two one three they crush your people they slay the widow and the alien they murder the fatherless nine four five six with cunning they conspire against your people they plot against those you cherish eight three three you hate all who do wrong you destroy those who tell lies bloodthirsty and deceitful men the lord abhors five five six to those unrepentant enemies of god the psalmist declares surely god will bring you down to everlasting ruin five two five surely god will crush the heads of his enemies of those who go on in their sins six eight two one and the purpose of these prayers for justice is declared then it will be known to the ends of the earth that god rules five nine one three to proclaim the powers of god six eight three four all kings will bow down to him and all nations will serve him seven two one one who knows the power of your anger for your wrath is as great as the fear that is due you nine zero one one yet despite the fact that nine zero of the one five zero psalms include imprecations prayers invoking god s righteous judgement upon the wicked such prayers are rare in the average western church however amongst the persecuted churches these prayers are much more common praying against the persecutors amidst the burnt out churches and devastation of marxist angola i found the survivors of communist persecution including the crippled and maimed and widows and orphans praying for god to strike down the wicked and remove the persecutors of the church i was shocked yet it was biblical even the martyrs in heaven pray how long sovereign lord holy and true until you judge the inhabitants of the earth and avenge our blood revelation six one zero the initiator of the communist persecution in angola was agestino neto described as a drunken psychotic marxist poet neto had been installed by cuban troops as the first dictator of angola he boasted that within two zero years there won t be a bible or a church left in angola i will have eradicated christianity yet despite the vicious wave of church burning and massacres it is not christianity that was eradicated in angola but agestino neto neto died in mysterious circumstances on an operating table in moscow in romania i learnt of a series of remarkable incidents recorded of god judging the persecutors of the church in answer to prayer a communist official ordered a certain pastor to be arrested the next day the official died of a heart attack another communist party official ordered that all the bibles in his district were to be collected and pulped to be turned into toilet paper this blasphemous project was in fact carried out but the next day when the official was medically examined he was informed that he had terminal cancer he died shortly afterwards on another occasion a communist official who had ordered a baptist church to be demolished by bulldozers died in a car crash the very next day when an order was given to dismantle a place of worship on the mountainside in a forest the workmen flatly refused to carry out the order at gunpoint a group of conscripted gypsies also refused to touch the church in desperation the communist police forced prisoners at bayonet point to dismantle the structure yet the officer in charge pleaded with the local christians to pray for him that god would not judge him he emphasised that he had nothing against christians and was only obeying strict orders the building was in fact reconstructed later and again used for worship they were all seized with sear and the name of the lord jesus was held in high honour in this way the word of the lord spread widely and grew in power acts one nine one seven two zero nicolae ceaucescu the dictator who ordered much of the persecution in romania was overthrown by his own army and executed on christmas day one nine eight nine to joyous shouts of the antichrist is dead in the streets many testified that this was in answer to the fervent prayers of the long suffering people of romania another persecutor of the church who challenged god was samora machel the first dictator of marxist mozambique samora machel was a cannibal who ate human flesh in witchcraft ceremonies in the one nine six zero s he pledged his soul to satan and vowed that he would destroy the church and turn mozambique into the first truly marxist leninist state in africa thousands of churches in mozambique were closed confiscated nationalised chained and padlocked burnt down or boarded up missionaries were expelled some being imprisoned first evangelism was forbidden bibles were ceremonially burnt and tens of thousands of christians including many pastors and elders were shipped off to concentration camps most were never seen again a month before his sudden death samora machel cursed god publicly and challenged him to prove his existence by striking him machel dead on one nine october one nine eight six while several churches were specifically praying for god to stop the persecution in mozambique machel s soviet tupelov aircraft crashed in a violent thunderstorm the plane crashed two zero zero metres within south africa s boundary with mozambique amidst the wreckage the marxist plans for overthrowing the government of malawi were discovered and published not only had god judged a blasphemer and a persecutor but he had also saved a country from persecution in the months leading up to the first multi party elections in zambia many churches fasted and prayed tor god to remove the two seven year socialist dictatorship of kenneth kaunda this was done on three one st october one nine nine one when fredrick chiluba a man converted to christ whilst imprisoned for opposing kaunda was elected president of zambia and covenanted to make zambia a christian country it is recorded in history that the wicked mary queen of scots declared trembling and in tears i am more afraid of john knox s prayers than of an army of ten thousand on three april one nine nine three the secretary general of the south african communist party chris hani was shot dead from the unprecedented international wave of condolences and adulation reported one could be forgiven for assuming that this man was a saint and a martyr certainly it was not the death and resurrection of christ jesus which dominated the thoughts and headlines of south africa this easter but the assassination of chris hani the stunning hypocrisy of the situation is that two zero one three five people were murdered in south africa in one nine nine two yet more collective concern and anguish were reported over the death of the head of the sa communist party than for all the thousands of other victims indeed the sa government the international community and the mass media have apparently had greater sorrow reported over this one death than for all the five zero zero zero zero south africans murdered since two nd february one nine nine zero when the anc sacp and pac were unbanned yet as a member of the anc revolutionary council since one nine seven three deputy commander of umkhonto we sizwe mk the anc s military wing from one nine eight two and chief of staff of mk from one nine eight seven chris hani had approved and ordered bombings and assassinations of many unarmed civilians as jesus warned all who live by the sword will die by the sword matt two six five two after personally confronting hani about his terrorist activities at a press conference in washington dc where he publicly declared his support for fidel castro col gaddafi yasser arafat and saddam hussein and defended the placing of car bombs and limpet mines in public places during the struggle i told him that i was a christian and while i didn t hate him i did hate communism and i was praying for him that god would either bring him to repentance and salvation in christ or that god would remove him he responded by swearing and declaring that he was an atheist several other people also prayed that god would either bring hani to repentance or remove him similarly several churches in america have begun to pray the imprecatory psalms against unrepentant abortionists in one town eight abortionists were struck down with heart attacks strokes car accidents and cancer within months of these public prayers for god to stop these killers of preborn babies some praised god for his righteous acts of judgement and quoted when justice is done it brings joy to the righteous and terror to evildoers proverbs two one one five others were shocked that any christian could express satisfaction at the misfortune of any even of the blatantly wicked yet the apostles prayed imprecatory prayers acts one three eight one two galatians one eight nine two tim four one four one five and so did our lord matt one one two zero two four what then should our attitude towards the imprecatory psalms be should we be praying the psalms to tackle these thorny issues i would like to present a short summary of an excellent book war psalms of the prince of peace lessons from the imprecatory psalms by james e adams published by the presbyterian and reformed publishing company our lord jesus christ but the prayers of a man for vengeance on his enemies just the opposite of jesus teaching that we should love our enemies yet two tim three one six one seven declares all scripture is god breathed and is useful for teaching rebuking correcting and training in righteousness so that the man of god may be thoroughly equipped for every good work see also two peter three one five one six the fact that something in the word of god is beyond our comprehension is not grounds to denying or even questioning its inspiration to make ourselves the judge of what is good or evil is to impudently take the place of god do we imagine ourselves to be holier than god wrong ideas of god have led many to become evangelic plastic surgeons who have made it their job to clean up god s word according to their own ideas of what is proper they have forgotten that it is god alone who must determine what christianity is and what is suitable for his church the essence of what many have done is to question the authority of god s word like eve s original sin of listening to satan s question yes hath god said the psalms are part of god s revelation of himself and his attributes and they are reaffirmed by the nt as the authoritative word of god those imprecatory psalms which these evangelical plastic surgeons reject as unsuited and unworthy for the church are the very psalms christ used to testify about himself eg mark one two three six matt two two four three four four and which the apostles used as authoritative scripture eg acts one one six two zero acts four two five heb four seven see also two samuel two three one two ch spurgeon said concerning the imprecatory psalms especially ps one zero nine truly this is one of the hard places of scripture a passage which the soul trembles to read yet it is not ours to sit in judgement upon it but to bow our ear to what the lord would speak to us therein the rejection of any part of god s word is a rejection of the giver of that word god himself two who is praying these psalms christ quoted the psalms not merely as prophesy he actually spoke the psalms as his own words the psalms occupied an enormous place in the life of our lord he used it as his prayer book and song book from the synagogue to the festivals and at the last supper on the cross christ quoted from the psalms not as some ancient authority that he adapted for his own use but as his very own words the words of the lord s anointed which as david s son he truly was father into your hands i commit my spirit ps three one five my god my god why have you forsaken me ps two two one in his ministry christ foretells what he will say as the judge on the day of judgement and he quotes the psalms in doing so matt seven two three then i will tell them plainly i never knew you away from me you evildoers ps six eight in heb one zero five the apostle attributes ps four zero six eight directly to christ although nowhere in the gospels is christ recorded as having said these words similarly hebrews two one two attributes ps two two two two directly to christ despite there being no record of his having spoken these words while on earth clearly the apostles believed christ is speaking in the psalms christ came to establish his kingdom and to extend his mercy in all the earth but let us never forget that jesus will come again to execute judgement on the wicked david as the anointed king of the chosen people of god was a prototype of jesus christ acts two three zero being therefore a prophet he foresaw and spoke of the resurrection of christ david was a witness to christ in his office in his lite and in his words the same words which david spoke the future messiah spoke through him the prayers of david were prayed also by christ or better christ himself prayed these psalms through his forerunner david the imprecatory psalms are expressions of the infinite justice of god of his indignation against wrong doing and his compassion for the wronged three but what about the psalms of repentance christ is also the lamb of god the substitutionary sacrifice for our sins christ in the day of his crucifixion was charged with the sin of his people he appropriated to himself those debts for which he had made himself responsible our lord was the substitution for the sinner he took the sinners place isaiah five three god made him who had no sin to be sin for us so that in him we might become the righteousness of god two cor five two one in history the psalms especially the imprecatory psalms have been understood to have been the prayers of christ by st augustine jerome ambrose tertullian luther and many others all the psalms are the voice of christ christ is praying the imprecatory psalms all the psalms are messianic it is the lord jesus christ who is praying these prayers of vengeance it is only right for the righteous king of peace to ask god to destroy his enemies these prayers signal an alarm to all who are still enemies of king jesus his prayers will be answered god s word is revealed upon all who oppose christ anyone who rejects god s way of forgiveness in the cross of christ will bear the dreadful curses of god he who prays psalm six nine two three two eight will one day make this prayer a reality when he declares to those on his left depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels matt two five four one all the enemies of the lord need to hear these psalms god s kingdom is at war the powers of evil will tall and god alone will reign forever with justice he judges and makes war out of his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations he will rule them with an iron sceptre he treads the winepress of the fury of the wrath of god almighty king of kings and lord of lords rev one nine one five four are jesus prayers contradictory what about jesus command to love our enemies and to bless those who curse us matt five four four christ is of course the loving and merciful saviour who forgives sin but he is also the awesome judge who is coming in judgement on those who disobey his gospel god is just he will pay back trouble to those who trouble you and give relief to you who are troubled this will happen when the lord jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful angels he will punish those who do not obey the gospel of our lord jesus they will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the lord and from the majesty of his power on the day he comes to be glorified in his holy people and to be marvelled at among au those who have believed two thess one six one zero jesus has power on earth to forgive sins and he has power on earth to execute judgement upon his enemies in the psalms we see both the vengeance and the love ot god even in the n t not a man was left judges four one five one six the account then goes on to describe how sisera escaped to the tent of jael where she lulled him into a false sense of safety and then drove a tent peg through his temple with a hammer the song of victory by deborah and barak celebrated the crushing of the head of sisera in graphic detail judges five two five two seven and it is this that psalm eight three implores god to again do to his enemies as you did to sisera six the blessings of obedience and the curse of disobedience the imprecatory psalms are fully consistent with the law of god if you do not carefully follow all the words of this law which are written in this book and do not revere this glorious and awesome name the lord your god the lord will send fearful plagues on you and your descendants he will bring upon you all the diseases of egypt that you dreaded and they will cling to you the lord will also bring on you every kind of sickness and disaster not recorded in this book of the law until you are destroyed because you did not obey the lord your god so it will please him to ruin and destroy you you will be uprooted from the land you are entering to possess deuteronomy two eight five eight six three the covenant god made with his people included curses for disobedience as well as blessings for obedience deuteronomy two seven records the formal giving and receiving of the covenant terms in an awesome account the levites shall recite to all the people of israel in a loud voice cursed is the man who carves an image or casts an idol a thing detestable to the lord the work of the craftsman s hands and sets it up in secret then all the people shall say amen cursed is the man who dishonours his father or his mother cursed is the man who moves his neighbour s boundary stone cursed is the man who leads the blind astray on the roads cursed is the man who withholds justice from the alien the fatherless or the widow cursed is the man who kills his neighbour secretly cursed is the man who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person cursed is the man who does not uphold the words of the law by carrying them out then all the people shall say amen deut two seven one four two six the new testament confirms that the inevitable consequence of rejecting christ is the curse if anyone does not love the lord a curse be on him one corinthians one six two two see also romans one two one nine two one hebrews one one three three seven one two three one five one nine one zero two six three one one two one four two nine seven how can we preach these prayers the church of jesus christ is an army under orders scripture constitutes the official dispatch from the commander in chief but we have a problem those who are called to pass on those orders to others are refusing to do so how then can we expect to be a united effective army is it any wonder that the troops have lost sight of their commission to demolish the strongholds of the kingdom of darkness if the church does not hear the battle cries of her captain how will she follow him onto the battlefield pastors are commissioned to pass on the orders of the church s commander never withholding or changing his words one whose job is to carry dispatches to troops in wartime would face certain and severe punishment if he dared to amend the general s orders the pastor s charge is of greater importance than that of a courier in any earthly army there s no place tor the dispatcher to decide he doesn t agree with his commander s strategy when jesus christ sent seventy two disciples on a preaching mission he told them to proclaim the coming of god s kingdom lk one zero nine that is to announce that people must submit to god s rule in their lives jesus instructed them to pray for peace on any house they approach assuring them that if anyone rejected it the peace would return on the disciples verse five but we must consider what he said they should do if their message were rejected that is if the hearers persisted in rebellion against god s rule but when you enter a town and are not welcomed go into its streets and say even the dust of your town that sticks to our feet we wipe off against you yet be sure of this the kingdom of god is near luke one zero one one what would be the result of that denunciation i tell you it will be more bearable on that day for sodom on which god sent fire from heaven in judgement for its wickedness than for that town verse one two immediately jesus added curses on korazin bethsaida and capernaum tor their rejection of his message verses one three one five he then explained to the disciples the great authority he had given them he who listens to you listens to me he who rejects you rejects me but he who rejects me rejects him who sent me verse one six this is the fundamental basis tor calling down god s curses on anyone his persistent rebellion against god s authority expressed in his law and the ministry of his servants we need to clearly and forcefully proclaim the war cries of the prince of peace only then will the church awake from its lethargy and once again enter the battle if we tail to pass on the battle cry then a lack of urgency and confusion in the ranks will be inevitable like psalm one our preaching needs to clearly show the blessings of obedience and the curse of disobedience the eternal truth is that god cannot be mocked whatever a man sows that shall he reap galatians six seven the curses pronounced on disobedience in deut two eight four seven five three were fulfilled in detail in samaria two kings six two another is prayer for judgement on those who finally refuse to be converted we handicap the army of god when we refuse to use both of these great weapons that he has given us it is at all times a part of the task of the people nf god to destroy evil if you have been guilty of dulling your sword by

 from aaronc athena mit edu aaron bryce cardenas subject re ethnicity in worship organization massachusetts institute of technology lines one six zero jerryl payne writes to sublimate a culture for the sake of what you perceive as unity seems antithetical to the very message of inclusion that you preach i agree with the exception that i don t preach ignoring our cultures the body as a whole must be unified the question is shall we be a melting pot boiling ourselves down to one legitimate expression or shall we be more like a stew maintaining the textural integrity of the expressed diversity while upholding the unity of thought it released all churches from the use of the latin mass unity to allow them to speak to the people in the common language diversity in revelation two three we see that in the first century church there was one congregation in each major city so there was one unified church now in each city there were people of different cultures naturally they formed something of a stew with different members having different heritages nevertheless they were one body they met together sometimes as smaller groups in their homes and sometimes in bigger groups in places such as the temple courts now in a particular city then and now you will find that there is a common language associated with that region for instance in rome latin was spoken in the united states today english is spoken so it would make sense that congregations in different cities would speak the common language and not necessarily latin naturally you would expect the lead evangelist to preach in the common language in the first century church there were probably many people in the congregation who could speak a given tongue to translate the message for people of foreign ethnic groups today however you don t see people speaking in tongues to translate sermons even in so called pentacostal churches we do have a modern day equivalent though bi lingual speakers now in the unified church of which i am a member sometimes called the international churches of christ when we all meet together on sundays there are headphones on people who don t speak english from which they hear an ongoing translation of the sermon in their native tongue neat idea huh now we meet in different size groups in a random sort of way on sundays so sometimes there will be a meeting of only haitians or of spanish speaking people for example who will hear an evangelist preach in their native language in addition we meet in small groups a couple of times during the week for bible discussion groups and devotionals so someone who speaks a different language will almost always be with people who also speak his language assuming the congregation is large enough for those meetings as for the people who speak the common language they can keep in touch with their culture if they want but they will also have equally deep friendships among their church relationships with people of many various nationalities has the purpose of the church been thwarted by this action the action of letting catholics worship in a native language instead of latin indeed not see my second paragraph in response to the second clipping of your article however if you mean the action of forming denominations based on a culture then the purpose of the church has been indeed thwarted i ll assume the second possiblility when answering your next clipping rather i believe it has been enhanced for paul exhorts us to become as one of them that we might reach them thus if a person or group of people feel more comfortable among their own shall we not give them a place where they can feel comfortable with their heritage and still love god you have met some needs of people certainly by helping them to be proud of their cultural heritages when most denominations didn t yet you have largely isolated yourselves from having quality christian friendships outside your nationality and your denomination we shall certainly give people a place to feel comfortable with their heritage however we will do this in a way that does not destroy church unity but rather encourages friendships among all disciples this is the approach of some of the groups that you cite it sounds like these groups have wonderful intentions but they are going about things in the wrong way and names like the african methodist episcopal church still make me cringe although not as much as before i understand that there was more racism in the past that caused such groups to be formed but now we should try to unite i know that it s hard for many people on this newsgroup to imagine there being only one body of people on earth but it is quite possible and i am working to make it happen however what might be a smaller step towards unity would be taking the word african out of your denomination s name then perhaps someday a long time off you can also remove the methodist episcopal part also and simply be part of the church with regard to inclusivity i note tht your sig emits from mit as you know the tute is religiously and culturally diversified and not everyone who comes there is immediately comfortable with english much less american culture what shall be the conduct of the campus churches then shall there be one church for the sake of unity or shall the organizations like kcf be useful in helping students new to america make the transition in culture language and thought there shall be one church for the sake of unity and it shall be useful in helping students new to america make the transition in culture language and thought we shouldn t make a new denomination to try to solve problems the whole denominational mindset only causes more problems sadly in the ame church we retain african cutlure at the root of our expression but we are by no means exclusive since you live in cambridge i invite you to visit the local assembly there thank you for the invitation that shows me that you indeed have the heart to spread the gospel of jesus as well as take part in your cultural heritage thank you also for responding to my post i know all too well how they can be very time

acapella singing that you mentioned in your post yet doesn t limit expression of my mexican culture even though i am in the mit campus ministry and not the spanish speaking zone i have made a commitment to god that i will go to the sunday services of my church because i know that my brothers and sisters here are fully devoted in love for god as his disciples i don t believe in tongues as you may have already picked up on because of my understanding of biblical christianity however i am certainly willing to visit your congregation provided that it doesn t interfere with my normal

 from noye midway uchicago edu vera shanti noyes subject re serbian genocide work of god reply to noye midway uchicago edu organization university of chicago lines one one four in article db seven n andrew cmu edu d andrew byler writes does he believe in predestination of course i believe in predestination it s a very biblical doctrine as romans eight two eight three zero shows among other passages furthermore the church has always taught predestination from the very beginning really you may be right but i d like proof as far as i know and i am not a div school student the catholic church does not seem to accept predestination my chaplain told me beware of greeks bearing gifts with reference to this doctrine it seems to have the curious result that human beings are not held responsible for their own actions i ll answer how you deal with this in a minute but to say that i believe in predestination does not mean i do not believe in free will men freely choose the course of their life which is also affected by the grace of god however unlike the calvinists and jansenists i hold that grace is resistable otherwise you end up with the idiocy of denying the universal saving will of god one timothy two four right that doesn t really seem like predestination to me but i ll continue with what you re saying for god must give enough grace to all to be saved but only the elect who he foreknew are predestined and receive the grace of final perserverance which guarantees heaven this does not mean that those without that grace can t be saved it just means that god foreknew their obstinacy and chose not to give it to them knowing they would not need it as they had freely chosen hell this is really confusing to me especially since i still believe that christ jesus died for all of us preknowledge of obstinacy seems like an awfully convoluted way to account for a couple of verses but then i am not really biblically supported in this opinion or am i others people who are saved are saved by the grace of god and not by their own effort for it was god who disposed them to himself and predestined them to become saints but those who perish in everlasting fire perish because they hardened their heart and chose to perish thus they were deserving of god s punishment as they had rejected their creator and sinned against the working of the holy spirit so god uses grace like margarine he only spreads it where it s needed and not where it isn t and so there are the saved and the not saved and nothing in between hmmmm yes it is up to god to judge but he will only mete out that punishment at the last judgement well i would hold that as god most certainly gives everybody some blessing for what good they have done even if it was only a little for those he can t bless in the next life he blesses in this one although i realize this doctrine was not originally intended to cause social problems it ends up doing just that if there is supposed to be some sort of sign that someone is elect like lots of children or success at work then those who have a good life on earth will go around thinking that those who don t are doomed to hell in a way though this sounds like the opposite idea those doomed to hell will have a great life on earth that s almost like the converse of what i believe responsibility for what we do now will be punished after we die you re saying what we get after we die has a direct bearing on how we live now strange and those he will not punish in the next life will be chastised in this one or in purgatory for their sins every sin incurs some temporal punishment thus god will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it cf two samuel one two one three one four david s sin of adultery and murder were forgiven but he was still punished with the death of his child and i need not point out the idea of punishment because of god s judgement is quite prevelant in the bible sodom and gommorrah moses barred from the holy land the slaughter of the cannanites annias and saphira jerusalem in seven zero ad etc so sin is either punished now or later and not both what if it s sort of half punished are there any grey areas in this doctrine my stuff deleted we should stop the slaughter of the innocent cf proverbs two four one one one two but does that mean that christians should support a war in bosnia with the u s or even the u n involved i do not think so but i am an isolationist and disagree with foreign adventures in general but in the case of bosnia i frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily involved it would not be a just war blessed after all are the peacemakers was what our lord said not the interventionists our actions in bosnia must be for peace and not for a war which is unrelated to anything to justify it for us the idea well my idea would be that you would intervene to establish peace and stop the atrocities i m not suggesting wwiii i don t really understand what you mean by a just war of course i am not an isolationist although i see some merit in not jumping in at the first opportunity can you say kuwait we happen to be a big country with a lot of resources as well as a lot of debt and this

 from hudson athena cs uga edu paul hudson jr subject re homosexuality issues in christianity organization university of georgia athens lines three seven in article noye midway uchicago edu writes i believe that the one important thing that those who wrote the old and new testament passages cited above did not know was that there is scientific evidence to support that homosexuality is at least partly inherent rather than completely learned note that scientific evidence in this area does not prove any conclusions there has been evidence to suggest that a certain part of homosexual s brains are different from heterosexuals but that proves very little also notice that the apostles did not have with them the scientific evidence linking certain genes with alcoholism or stealing with certain genetic problems even if they did have scientific evidence i doubt it would have stopped them from communicating the teaching from the holy spirit that these things are sinful this reminds me of a conversation with a professor of mine he said something very true christianity teaches that we should not give in to our every inclination most people do give in to their leanings in christianity we have the concept of struggling with the flesh and bringing it into submission one person may have a problem with his temper and having a murderous heart another may have a problem with homosexuality another may be inclined to greed but god offers us the opportunity to be more than conquerers sources where you can find this information there is homosexual behavior recorded among monkeys and other animals which is in itself suggestive that it is inherent rather than learned or at least that the word unnatural shouldn t really apply the preying mantis bites the head off of her mate after she mates with him is it natural for a woman to do the same thing to her husband the bible is concerned with human morality and only touches on animal morality as it relates to humans link hudson

 from mls panix com michael siemon subject re homosexuality issues in christianity organization panix public access unix nyc lines nine seven in djohnson cs ucsd edu darin johnson writes ok what s more important to gay christians sex or christianity i m afraid i see that question as very tendentious try rephrasing it what s more important to christians love of god or love of other human beings to which of course the only conceivable answer is that the one is like the other i am deeply suspicious of any flavor of christianity which would elevate one clause of the great commandment to a priority over the other such as to claim a conflict true we are told to let the dead bury the dead to hate family rather than let it keep us from following christ but the dichotomy here is not one between love of our fellows and love of god but of allowing social constructs to blind us to the presense of god it is particularly satanic to twist love of god in such a manner as to become an excuse to treat others as on a different level than the one who is so caught up in love of god the trouble comes in the relation of human love and human sex yes it has sometimes been the case that the church has taught that all sex was nasty evil sinful stuff but when man and wife leave their parental homes to become helpmates living in one flesh it is the sex that is the vehicle of becoming one flesh if you doubt me read st paul on what is wrong with frequenting prostitutes less provocatively what i mean is just this sexual bonding is a deeply founded aspect of our social interaction and in particular is the foundation of the institution of marriage so that unlike with many mammals human males remain with and foster the children they beget and support their children s mothers this is the schema behind genesis two one eight two four and behind jesus citation of that passage i observe by the way that not all human males in fact do as i have just described but another thing that characterizes human societies is our raising of non begotten children not only orphans and adoptees and the like but products of the quite common infidelities of humans to their spouses we are in this not unique in the animal world but the full extent of social consequences and implications is most intricate for us yes of course it sometimes goes wrong like all else we do it is infected with sin and you find married couples where there is no bond and people so deliriously addicted to the initial stages of sexual bond formation the infatuation falling in love phase that they break any forming bond in order to keep stepping over the threshold of the deep unity god has prepared for us and stepping back out again right away satan may indeed use sex as a very handy tool to corrupt human love but in the edenic creation that is not its nature and with god s grace under the power of christ to make all things new it need not be a problem for christians though we must be vigilant even in christ as the devil is watchful prowling around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour so returning to the original question what is more important to straight christians sex or christianity paul clearly tended to think that sex was at best a distraction from christianity though to be charitable to him his context was in expectation of immediate parousia so that the hard tasks of a married union the lifelong building and adaptation to each other seemed somehow to undercut the proper preparation for an immediate eschaton since we do not know the hour of return we should act both with instant readiness for that and with a commitiment to our mates that proposes a long lifetime together and telling people not to bond in such a perspective strikes me as crippling us in the second clause of the the commandment to love i would claim that only a very few saints have the capacity to deeply love without sexual tinges or complication mind you their fellow human beings unless they have had a deeply spiritual life in married union growing together as one flesh and that means in the type case with a persistent and continued sexual relationship we are human and little good comes of trying to mortify the flesh to the point of pretending to be otherwise pretending not to be sexual beings christianity i would hope would they be willing to forgo sex completely in order to avoid being a stumbling block to others it depends entirely on context if that context is major hypocrisy on the part of those who find us stumbling blocks i am much less of a mind to efface myself so that they can pontificate about my sins there are some people for whom a life of celibacy is a spritual gift and maybe even a victory against a to them troubling sexual urge that seems to them to lead only to sin nothing i say should ever be read as demeaning such a gift nor the even rarer gift of love for all our conspecifics and indeed for all god s creation that can develop to the full without the tutoring of a spousal helpmate marriage founded in sex but there is a difference between spiritual gifts and penance telling people that they have to have a particular gift or else what is fraught with manipulation and disregard of the differences of our spiritual endowments from god to one person is given the gift of speaking in toungues to another intepretation of toungues to yet another prophecy and to still another teaching the notion that some particular gift is required of all is one of the earliest heresies michael l siemon i say you are gods sons of the mls panix com most high

 from brother roy almac co uk brother roy subject rfd soc religion taize organization almac bbs ltd four four zero three two four six six five three seven one lines one one four nntp posting host rodan uu net this is a rfd on a proposal for a newsgroup which would promote a sharing on the johannine hours as proposed each month by the monks of the ecumenical community of taize pronounced te zay in france name of proposed newsgroup soc religion taize unmoderated purpose of the group the taize community is an international ecumenical community of monks based in france many young adults come there to search for meaning in their life and to deepen their understanding of their faith through a sharing with others this newsgroup will allow such a sharing through a monthly johannine hour which will be posted at the beginning of each month a johannine hour involves a short commentary on a given bible passage followed by some questions for reflection any thoughts that may arise in consequence and that you wish to share with others can be posted here we are not interested in theological debate and even less in polemics no expertise is required the idea is to help one another to deepen our understanding of scripture as it is related to our own life journey the idea of johannine hours was born in taize as a simple response to all those who were trying to assimilate the bible s message in the midst of their daily life because of work or studies it is often impossible to spend long hours in silence and reflection but everyone can take an hour from time to time to enter a church sit quietly at home or go out for a walk in the woods there in silence we can meditate on a passage of scripture to listen to the voice of christ during the time of silence it is important to concentrate on what we understand and not waste time worrying if in some biblical expressions we find it difficult to hear the voice of christ the idea is to communicate to others what we have understood of christ not burdening them with our own hesitations but rather telling them what has brought us joy what has led us to run the risk of trusting more deeply perhaps those who read and think about the johannine hours in this newsgroup could share their reflections and discoveries with others the important thing is the complementarity between two aspects the personal aspect of silent personal reflection and the communal aspect of sharing which through usenet makes us a part of a worldwide network background of the taize community the following provides some background information on the life and vocation of the taize pronounced te zay community a parable of communion august one nine four zero with europe in the grip of world war ii brother roger aged two five set up home in the

intercontinental meetings take place each week sunday to sunday throughout the year and they include youth from between three five and six zero countries during any one week the meetings give each

of young adults from every part of europe for several days in a major city there have also been meetings in asia and in the united states every year brother roger writes an open letter to the young

cc iup edu someone named mark writes do not be deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers nor effeminate nor homosexuals nor thieves nor the covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor swindlers shall inherit the kingdom of god and such were some of you i cor six nine one one the moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of porneia in this i think we can all agree with paul that there are some kinds of activity that could be named by fornication or theft or coveting or reviling or drunkenness which would well deserve condemnation we may or may not agree to the bounds of those categories however and the very fact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at all clear but that paul an excellent rhetorician had no interest in making them clear leaving matters rather to our spirit led decisions with all the uncomfortable living with other readings that has dominated christian discussion of all these areas what is fornication sex outside of marriage abuse of sex is not homosexual intercourse outside the context of marriage isn t it an unatural use of what god has given us why is it that homosexuals are using the grace of god as a license to practice sin for certain persons have crept in unnoticed those who were long beforehand marked out for this condemnation ungodly persons who turn the grace of our god into licentiousness and deny our only master and lord jesus christ jude four nasb what is defined by god as a legitimate marriage for this cause a man shall leave his father and his mother and shall cleave to his wife and the shall become one flesh gen two two four nasb and he answer and said have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife and the two shall become one flesh consequently they are no longer two but one flesh what therefore god has joined together let no man separate matt one nine four six nasb but because of immoralities let each man have his own wife and let each woman have her own husband let the husband fulfill his duty to his wife and likewise also the wife to her husband one corinthians seven four five nasb there are plenty of laws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in leviticus most of which christians ignore completely they never even bother to examine them they just assume that they know which ones are moral and which ones are ritual well i have news for you any anthropology course should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs unlcean as categories in an awful lot of societies we have them too but buried pretty deep and i cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of leviticus from the ritual law which no christian i know feels applies to us i disagree every law that is written in leviticus should be looked at as sin that is why we have a need for a savior i can understand someone who may not know a particular sin listed in the levitcal law but i would hope that they would repent when confronted with it i notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse well la ti da so what this is almost as slimey an argument as the one that homosexuality rape i know of no one who argues seriously though one can always find jokers in defense of bestiality it is absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay christians do raise which concern sexual activity within committed consensual human adult realtionships so that your bringing it up is no more relevant than the laws of kashrut if you cannot address the actual issues you are being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the world if you want to address bestiality that is your business not mine and attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in our culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing us as human beings you want to dismiss us and use the sleaziest means you can think of to do so also i noticed that the preceeding verses say also you shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness during her menstrual impurity and you shall not have intercourse with your neighbors wife to be defiled with her leviticus one eight one nine two zero nasb these verses are just as relevant as you shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female it is an abomination leviticus one eight two two nasb why was god telling the israelites not to practice such things do not defile yourselves by any of these things for by all these the nations which i am casting out before you have become defiled for the land has become defiled therefore i have visited its punishment upon it so the land has spewed out its inhabitants but as for you you are to keep my statutes and judgments and shall not do any of these abominations neither the native nor the alien who sojourns among you leviticus one eight two four two six nasb he is the lord listen to what he has to say nobody wants to dismiss homosexuals we do love you but we don t agree that what you practice is not sin you have not truly repented of your sin we hate the sin that is within your lives i hate sin that is in my life all christians should hate the sin that is within their own lives confrontaion with sin should bring about repentance yes i agree with john three one seven but i also know that jesus said repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand matt three one seven if you don t agree that homosexuality is sin than how can you repent from it

 from sun zero seven five gerry palo uunet uu net gerry palo subject re portland earthquake lines six eight austin c archer archau saturn wwc edu wrote i am interested in views about the non event of may three seriously how can a christian discriminate between messages from god which are to be taken seriously and those which are spurious is there a useful heuristic which would help us avoid embracing messages which by their non fulfillment are proven to be false thus causing the name of christ to be placed in disrepute is this a problem at all it is possible that the individual saw a true prophetic vision but that he interpreted the scale of time and space according to his material con sciousness translating the supersensible perceptions of a plane above that of time and space into an immediate worldly context and getting it wrong not that he did it rationally but rather that unconsciously the perceptions became clothed in material images instead of remaining in the realm of the potential and not yet time space bound this difficulty of translating prophetic vision into a concrete when and where has always been difficult even for the prophets of old that is why their prophecies are so often subject to multiple interpretations likewise the apostles seemed to feel that the return of the lord was to be very soon in the sense of perhaps the same generation yet the meaning of very soon has proven to be different than they could grasp prophetic vision tends to telescope time so that things that are far off appear to be very close another possibility is that the vision was one of a real event preparing to happen again in the realm of the potential but not yet manifest and which was thwarted by other forces including possibly an act of divine mercy there are many concrete prophecies being made these days by devout and sincere and sober christians and others too it seems that great coming events are really casting their shadow before their arrival in these apocalyptic times the various predictions i m talking about those that appear to be sincere and sober are hard to accept yet hard to ignore com pletely one has the feeling something is about to start to get ready to begin to commence to happen we are living as the chinese saying goes in interesting times as for how to discriminate the bible doesn t help much there is an old testament passage i forget where it is that says you will know whether a prophet is true by whether or not his prophecy comes to pass that helps eliminate the failures after the fact but in the case of an earth quake it is small comfort it seems to me that all prophecies that give specific times and places and events should be suspect not in that they are necessarily false but in the sense stated above that all such visions are subject to mistranslation from the plane of prophetic vision to the plane of earthly time and space for what it is worth rudolf steiner once was asked whether a modern initiate could see into the future and predict coming events his answer was that it would be possible but then he would have to withdraw from active parti cipation in them including proclaiming what he saw if this is in fact a spiritual law then the answer to your question about how to discriminate is that the one who makes such prophecies is probably violating that law knowingly or unknowingly and as such his message should be considered a priori to be dubious i e i would expect that those capable of making true predictions and giving accurate expression to them would not do so in the way that the prophet of the oregon earthquake did however i can sympathize with the person who published the prophecy given the same overwhelming experience that he apparently had i too might feel impelled and even commissioned by god to tell my fellow human beings about what i had seen gerry palo seven three two three seven two zero zero six compuserve com do any of our church historian readers know whether there s any more prophecy now than there has been in the past i don t get that impression clh
 from rexlex fnnews fnal gov subject arsenokoitai four organization fnal lines two five eight continuing part four i think used by permission the source and nt meaning of arsenokoitai with implications for christian ethics and ministry james b deyoung w petersen more recently wright s understanding has itself been questioned from a different direction in a brief one nine eight six study william petersen found linguistic confusion in using the english word homosexuals as the meaning of arsenokoitai two two he faulted wright and english bible translaions for rendering it by homosexuals in i cor six nine and i tim one one zero in a sense petersen has coalesced bailey boswell and scroggs into a single assertion that reiterates in effect the position of bailey he finds homosexuals unacceptable as a translation because it is anachronistic a major disjunction exists between contemporary thought and terminology and the thought and terminolgy in paul s time one eight seven eight eight what is this disjunction he bases it on historical and linguistic facts accordingly ancient greek and roman society treated male sexuality as polyvalent and characterized a person sexually only by his sexual acts virtually all forms of behavior except transvestism were acceptable christianity simply added the categories of natural and unnatural in describing these actions ancient society know nothing of the categories of homosexuals and heterosexuals and assumed that in the words of dover quoted approvingly by petersen everyone responds at different times to both homosexual and to heterosexual stimuli one eight eight two three in contrast to this modern usage virtually limits the term homosexual to desire and propensity k m benkert who in one eight six nine coined the german term equivalent to homosexual used it as referring to orientation impluse or affectional preference and having nothing to do with sexual acts one eight nine petersen then proceeds to cite the supplement to the oxford english dictionary which defines homosexual only as a propensity or desire with no mention of acts petersen s point is that by using homosexuals for arsenokoitai one wrongfully reads a modern concept back into early history where no equivalent concept existed one eight nine consequently the translation is inaccurate because it includes celibate homophiles incorrectly exludes heterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts andincorrectly includes female homosexuals one nine eight nine prior to one eight six nine there was no cognitive structure either inour society or in antiquity within which the modern bifurcation of humanity into homosexuals and hetersosexuals made sence one eight nine the foregoing clarifies why petersen feels that the translatio homosexual is mistaken yet is it possible that petersen is the one mistaken on both historical and linguistic or philological grounds the next phases of this paper will critically examine petersen s position the justification for translating arsenokoitai by homosexuals historical grounds a refutation of the foregoing opposition to the traslation of arsenokoitai by homosexuals begins with the historical and cultural evidence since virtually everyone acknowledges that the word does not appear before paul s usage no historical settings earlier than his are available yet much writing reveals that ancient understanding of homosexuality prior to and contemporary with paul the goal is to discover wheither the ancient s conceived of homosexuality particularly homosexual orientation in a way similar to present day concepts peterson bailey boswell and scroggs claim that the homosexual condition desire propensity or inversion whatever it is called cannot be part of the definition of the term they assert this either because the term is limited to acts of particular kind boswell active male prostitutes scroggs pederasty or because the homosexual condition was unknown in ancient times bailey petersen the following discussion will show why neither of these positions is legitimate attention will be devoted to the latter postion first with the former one being addressed below under linguistic grounds in regard to the latter position one may rightfully ask did not the homosexual condition exist before one eight six nine is it only a modern phenomenon yet if it is universal as alleged today it must have existed always including ancient times even though there is lack of sophistication in discussing it indeed evidence show that the ancients pre christian and christian not only knew about the total spectrum of sexual behavior including all forms of same sex activity transvestism included but also knoew about same sex orientation or condition petersen admits one nine zero n one zero that plato in symposium one eight nine d one nine two d may be a sole possible exception to ancient ingnorance of this condition he discounts this however believing that even here acts appear to be the deciding factor however this is a very significant exception hardly worthy of being called an exception because of the following additional evidence for a homosexual condition the symposium of plato gives some of the strongest evidence for knowledge about the homosexual condition two four plato posits a third sex comprised of a maile female androgynon man woman hence original nature palai physis consisted of three kinds of human beings zeus sliced these human beings in half to weaken them so that they would not be a threat to the gods consequently each person seeks his or her other half either one of the opposite sex or one of the same sex plato then quotes aristophances each of us then is but a tally of a man since every one shows like a flatfish the traces of having been sliced in two and each is ever searching for the tally that will fit him all the men who are sections of that composite sex that at first was called man woman are woman courters our adulterers are mostly descended from that sex whence likewise are derived our mancourting women and adulteresses all the women who are sections of the woman have no great fancy for men they are incllined rather to women and of this stock are the she minions men who are sections of the male pursue the masculine and so long as their boyhood lasts they show themselves to be sliced of the male by making griends with men and delighting to lie with them and to be clasped in men s embrasces these are the finest boys and striplings for they have the most manly nature some say they are shameless creatures but falsely for their behavior is due not to shamelessness but to daring manliness and virility since they are quick to welcome their like sure evidence of this is the fact that on reaching maturity these alone prove in a public career to be men so when they come to man s estate they are boy lovers and have no natural interest in wiving and getting children but only do these things under stress of custom they are quite contented to live together unwedded all their days a man of this sort is at any rate born to be a lover of boys or the willing mate of a man eagerly greeting his own kind well when one of them whether he be a boy lover or a lover of any other sort happens on his own particular half the two of them are wondrously thrilled with affection and intimacy and love and are hardly to be induced to leave each other s side for a single moment these are they who continue together throughout life though they could not even say what they would have of one another one nine one d one

zero one c desire is felt for what is not provided or present for something they have not or are not or lack this is the object of desire and love socrates clearly distinguishes between what sort of being is love and the works of love two zero one e this ancient philosopher could think of both realms seaual acts as well as disposition of being or nature his wors have significance for more than pederasty two six in summary virtually every element in the modern discussion of love and homosexuality is anticipated in the symposium of plato petersen is in error when he claims that the ancients could only think of homosexual acts not inclination or orientation widespread evidence to the contray supports the latter two seven biblical support for homosexuality inclination in the contexts where homosexual acts are discribed adds to the case for the ancient distinction in rom one two one two eight such phrases as reasoning heart becoming foolish desires of the heart and reprobate mind prove

 from hedrick geneva rutgers edu subject faq essay on homosexuality lines four five two someone referred to my faq essay on homosexuality since it hasn t been posted for some time and i ve modified it somewhat since the last time i m taking this opportunity to post it there is another entry in the faq containing comments by some other contributors they can be retrieved from ftp rutgers edu as pub soc religion christian others homosexuality it contains far more detail on the exegetical issues than i give here though primarily from a conservative point of view this posting summarizes several issues involving homosexuality and christians this is a frequently asked question so i do not post the question each time it occurs rather this is an attempt to summarize the postings we get when we have a discussion it summarizes arguments for allowing christian homosexuality since most people asking the question already know the arguments against it the most common but not the only question dealt with herein is how can a christian justify being a homosexual given what the bible says about it first on the definition of homosexual many groups believe that there is a homosexual orientation i e a sexual attraction to members of the same sex this is distinguished from actual homosexual sexual activity homosexuals who abstain from sex are considered by most groups to be acceptable however in a lot of discussion the term homosexual means someone actually engaging in homosexual sex this is generally not accepted outside the most liberal groups in this paper i m going to use homosexual as meaning a person engaging in sexual acts with another of the same sex i haven t heard of any biblical argument against a person with homosexual orientation who remains celebate i think most people now admit that there is a predisposition to be homosexual this is often called a homosexual orientation it is not known whether it is genetic or environmental there is evidence suggesting each the best evidence i ve seen is that homosexuality is not a single phenomenon but has a number of different causes one of them is probably genetic there are several groups that try to help people move from being homosexual to heterosexual the best known is exodus international the reports i ve seen and i haven t read the detailed literature just the summary in the minority opinion to the presbyterian church s infamous report on human sexuality suggest that these programs have very low success rates and that there are questions about how real even the successes are but there certainly are people who say they have converted however this issue is not as important as it sounds those who believe homosexuality is wrong believe it is intrinsically wrong defined as such by god the fact that it s hard to get out of being a homosexual is no more relevant than the fact that it s hard to escape from being a drug addict if it s wrong it s wrong it may affect how we deal with people though if it s very difficult to change this may tend to make us more willing to forgive it one more general background issue it s common to quote a figure that one zero of the population is homosexual i asked one of our experts where this came from here s his response kinsey see below is the source of the figure one zero percent he defines sexuality by behavior not by orientation and ranked all persons on a scale from zero completely heterosexual to six completely heterosexual according to kinsey one third of all male adults have had at least one experience of orgasm homosexually post puberty ten percent of all adult males have most of their experiences of homosexually that was in one nine four eight the percentages held true in a followup study done by the kinsey institute based on data in the early seventies but not published until the early eight zero s or so by bell and weinberg i believe i can t put my hand on this latter reference but here is the online information for kinsey s own study as

journalist is running the rounds of talk shows this season promoting her book that allegedly refutes kinsey s study but the scholarly world seems to take her for a kook i ve seen some objections to the kinsey s study but not in enough detail to include here if someone would like to contribute another view i d be willing to include it most christians believe homosexuality at least genital sex is wrong not all however a few denominations accept it the metropolitan community churches is the best known it was formed specifically to accept homosexuals however the united church of christ also allows it and i think a couple of other groups may as well the episcopal church seems to accept it some areas but not others in churches that have congregational government you ll find a few congregations that accept it even among southern baptists though the number is probably only one or two congregations but these are unusual few churches permit homosexual church leaders how carefully they enforce this is another issue i don t have any doubt that there are homosexual pastors of just about every denomination some more open than others as to the arguments over the biblical and other issues here s an attempt to summarize the issues the most commonly cited reference by those favoring acceptance of homosexuality in previous discussions has been john boswell christianity social tolerance and homosexuality u chicago press one nine eight zero the argument against is pretty clear there are several explicit laws in the ot e g leviticus two zero one three and in rom one paul seems pretty negative on homosexuality beyond these references there are some debates some passages often cited on the subject probably are not relevant e g the sin which the inhabitants of sodom proposed to carry out was homosexual rape not homosexual activity between consenting adults there s even some question whether it was homosexual since the entities involved were angels it was particularly horrifying because it involved guests and the responsibility towards guests in that culture was very strong this is probably the reason lot offered his daughter it was better to give up his daughter than to allow his guests to be attacked if you look through a concordance for references to sodom elsewhere in the bible you ll see that few seem to imply that homosexuality was their sin there s a jewish interpretive tradition that the major sin was abuse of guests at any rate there s no debate that homosexual rape is wrong i do not discuss leviticus because the law there is part of a set of laws that most christians do not consider binding so unless nt justification can be found lev alone would not settle the issue the nt references are all in paul s letters a number of the references from paul are lists of sins in which the words are fairly vague boswell argues that the words occuring in these lists do not mean homosexual here s what he says the two greek words that appear in the lists i e i cor six nine and i tim one one zero are malakos and arsenokoitai unfortunately it is not entirely clear what the words actually mean malakos with a basic meaning of soft has a variety of metaphorical meanings in ethical writing boswell suggests wanton as a likely equivalent he also reports that the unanimous interpretation of the church including greek speaking christians was that in this passage it referred to masturbation a meaning that has vanished only in the two zero th cent as that practice has come to be less frowned upon he cites references as late as the one nine six seven edition of the catholic encyclopedia that identify it as masturbation he translates arsenokotai as male prostitute giving evidence that none of the church fathers understood the term as referring to homosexuality in general a more technical meaning suggested by the early latin translations would be active mode homosexual male prostitute but in his view paul did not intend it so technically for a more conservative view i consulted gordon fee s commentary on i cor he cites evidence that malakos often meant effeminate however boswell warns us that in greek culture effeminate is not necessarily synonymous with homosexual though it may be associated with some kinds of homosexual behavior given what boswell and fee say taken together i suspect that the term is simply not very definite and that while it applies to homosexuals in some cases it isn t a general term for homosexuality while fee argues against boswell with arsenokotai as well he ends up suggesting a translation that seems essentially the same the big problem with it is that the word is almost never used paul s writing is the first occurence the fact that the word is clearly composed of male and f k unfortunately doesn t quite tell us the meaning since it doesn t tell us whether the male is the subject or object of the action examples of compound words formed either way can be given in theory it could refer to rapists etc it s dangerous to base meaning purely on etymology or you ll conclude that goodbye is a religious expression because it s based on god by with ye however since boswell fee and niv seem to agree on homosexual male prostitute that seems as good a guess as any note that this translation misses the strong vulgarity of the term however something which fee and boswell agree on but do not attempt to reproduce in their translation in my opinion the strongest nt reference to homosexuality is romans one boswell points out that rom one speaks of homosexuality as something that happened to people who were naturally heterosexual as a result of their corruption due to worshipping false gods one could argue that this is simply an example that if a homosexual worshipped false gods he would also fall into degradation and perhaps become heterosexual however i find this argument somewhat forced and in fact our homosexual readers have not seriously proposed that this is what paul meant however i am not convinced that rom one is sufficient to create a law against homosexuality for christians what paul is describing in rom one is not homosexuality among christians it s homosexuality that appeared among idolaters as one part of a whole package of wickedness despite the impression left by his impassioned rhetoric i m sure paul does not believe that pagans completely abandoned heterosexual sex given his description of their situation i rather assume that their heterosexual sex would also be debased and shameless so yes i do believe that this passage indicates a negative view of homosexuality but in all fairness the shameless nature of their acts is a reflection of the general spiritual state of the people and not a specific feature of homosexuality my overall view of the situation is the following i think we have enough evidence to be confident that paul disapproved of homosexuality rom one seems clear while i cor six nine and i tim one one zero are not unambiguous and general condemnations of homosexuality they do not seem like wording that would come from someone who approved of homosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases on the other hand none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the subject rom one is really about idolatry it refers to homosexuality in passing the result of this situation is that people interpret these passages in light of their general approach to scripture for those who look to scripture for laws about issues such as this it not surprising that they would consider these passages to be nt endorsement of the ot prohibition for those whose approach to the bible is more liberal it is not surprising that they regard paul s negative view of homosexuality as something that he took from his jewish upbringing without any serious reexamination in the light of the gospel as readers of this group know by now the assumptions behind these approaches are so radically different that people tend to foam at the mouth when they see the opposing view described there s not a lot i can do as moderator about such a situation a number of discussions in the past centered around the sort of detailed exegesis of texts that is described above however in fact i m not convinced that defenders of homosexuality actually base their own beliefs on such analyses the real issue seems to rest on the question of whether paul s judgement should apply to modern homosexuality one commonly made claim is that paul had simply never faced the kinds of questions we are trying to deal with he encountered homosexuality only in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was wrong he had never faced the experience of christians who try to act straight and fail and he had never faced christians who are trying to define a christian homosexuality which fits with general christian ideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the relationship between god and man it is unfair to take paul s judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make judgements on these questions another is the following in paul s time homosexuality was associated with a number of things that christians would not find acceptable it was part of temple prostitution among private citizens it often occured between adults and children or free people and slaves i m not in a position to say that it always did but there are some reasons to think so the ancients distinguished between the active and passive partner it was considered disgraceful for a free adult to act as the passive partner this is the reason that an active mode homosexual prostitute would be considered disgraceful his customers would all be people who enjoyed the passive role this supports the idea that it would tend not to be engaged in between two free adult males at least not without some degree of scandal clearly christian homosexuals would not condone sex with children slaves or others who are not in a position to be fully responsible partners however fee s commentary on i cor cites some examples from ancient literature of homosexual relationships that do seem to involve free adults in a reasonably symmetrical way thus the considerations in this paragraph shouldn t be pushed too far homosexuality may have been discredited for jews by some of these associations but there surely must be been cases that were not prostitutes and did not involve slaves or children some people have argued that aids is a judgement against homosexuality i d like to point out that aids is transmitted by promiscuous sex both homosexual and heterosexual someone who has a homosexual relationship that meets christian criteria for marriage is not at risk for aids note that there is good reason from paul s general approach to doubt that he would concede homosexuality as a fully equal alternative apart from any specific statements on homosexuality i believe his use of the genesis story would lead him to regard heterosexual marriage as what god ordained however the way paul deals with pastoral questions provides a warning against being too quick to deal with this issue legally i claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual christians is not entirely a theological issue but also a pastoral one paul s tendency as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating holidays is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues to look very carefully at the good of the people involved and to avoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging for example while paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat meat he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about which they had personal qualms for another example paul obviously would have preferred to see people at least in some circumstances remain unmarried yet if they were unable to do so he certainly would rather see them married than in a state where they might be tempted to fornication i believe one could take a view like this even while accepting the views paul expressed in rom one one may believe that homosexuality is not what god intended that it occured as a result of sin but still conclude that at times we have to live with it note that in the creation story work enters human life as a result of sin this doesn t mean that christians can stop working when we are saved the question is whether you believe that homosexuality is in itself sinful or whether you believe that it s a misfortune that is in a broad sense due to human sinfulness if you re willing to consider the latter approach then it becomes a pastoral judgement whether there is more damage caused by finding a way to live with it or trying to cure it the dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often fails and when it does you end up with damage ranging from psychological damage to suicide as well as broken marriages when attempts at living as a heterosexual fail this is going to depend upon one s assessment of the inherent nature of homosexuality if you believe it is a very serious wrong then you may be willing to run high risks of serious damage to get rid of it clearly we do not generally suggest that people live with a tendency to steal or with drug addiction even though attempts to cure these conditions are also very difficult however these conditions are intrinsically damaging in a way that is not so obvious for homosexuality many problems associated with homosexuality are actually problems of promiscuity not homosexuality this includes aids i take for granted that the only sort of homosexual relationships a christian would consider allowing would be equivalent to christian heterosexual relationships in the course of discussing this over the last decade or so we ve heard a lot of personal testimony from fellow christians who are in this situation i ve also seen summaries of various research and the results of various efforts for conversion aside from the presbyterian report mentioned above there s an faq that summarizes our readers reports on this question the evidence is that long term success in changing orientation is rare enough to be on a par with healing miracles the danger in advising christians to depend upon such a change is clear when conversion doesn t happen which is almost always the people are often left in despair feeling excluded from a church that has nothing more to say but a requirement of life long celibacy paul recognized though in a different context that such a demand is not practical for most people and i think the history of clerical celibacy has strongly reinforced that judgement the practical result is that homosexuals end up in the gay sex clubs and the rest of the sordid side of homosexuality maybe homosexuality isn t god s original ideal but i can well imagine paul preferring to see people in long term committed christian relationships than promiscuity as with work which genesis suggests wasn t part of god s original ideal either i think such relationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing god s love with each other there s an issue of biblical interpretation underlying this discussion the issue is that of cultural relativism that is when paul says that something is wrong should this be taken as an eternal statement or are things wrong because of specific situations in the culture of the time conservative christians generally insist on taking prohibitions as absolute since otherwise the bible becomes subjective what is to stop us from considering everything in it as relative when looking at this issue it s worth noting that no one completely rejects the concept of cultural relativism there are a number of judgements in the new testament that even conservative christians consider to be relative the following judgements are at least as clear in the bible as anything said on homosexuality prohibition against charging interest this occurs one eight times in the ot it s not in the nt but i mention it here because until relatively recently the church did consider it binding on christians prohibition against swearing oaths endorsement of slavery as an institution judgement of tax collectors as sinner we do not regard these items as binding in most cases i believe the argument is essentially one of cultural relativism briefly prohibition of interest is appropriate to a specific agrarian society that the bible was trying to build but not to our market economy few people believe that american judicial oaths have the same characteristics as the kind of oaths jesus was concerned about most people believe that paul was simply telling people how to live within slavery but not endorsing it as an institution for people believe that the irs is morally equivalent to roman tax farming the point i m trying to make is that before applying biblical prohibitions to the two zero th cent we need to look at whether the two zero th cent actions are the same when christian homosexuals say that their relationships are different than the greek homosexuality that paul would have been familiar with this is exactly the same kind of argument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors until fairly recently christians prohibited taking of interest and many christians regarded slavery as divinely endorsed indeed slavery is one of the more common metaphors for the relationship between god and human beings christians are often called servants or slaves of god i am not trying to say that everything in the bible is culturally relative rather i m trying to say that some things are and therefore it is not enough to say that because something appears in the bible that ends the discussion we need to look at whether the action we re talking about now has the same moral implications as the one that the bible was talking about if christians want to argue that there are reasons to think that the prohibitions against homosexuality are still binding i m willing to listen those who claim that the question doesn t need to be looked at are kidding themselves unless they are part of the small minority who really obey all the rules listed above one thing that worries me is the great emotions that this issue creates when you consider the weakness of the biblical evidence some laws in leviticus a passage in rom whose subject matter is really idolatry rather than homosexuality and a couple of lists whose words are ambiguous the amount of concern this is raising among christians seems rather out of proportion this should suggest to people that there are reasons other than simply biblical involved this is true on both sides clearly homosexual christians are as strongly motivated to find ways of discrediting the biblical arguments as conservative christians are to find biblical arguments but i can t help feeling that the bible is being used by both sides as a way of justifying attitudes which come from other sources this is a dangerous situation for christians on the other side of the issue i would like to note some problems i have with the pro homosexual position as it is commonly presented one of the most common arguments is that homosexuality is biologically determined i e god made me homosexual and i have no choice i think god made me homosexual is a fine view for people who already believe on other grounds that homosexuality is acceptable but i don t see it as an argument for acceptability many people think that alcholism is largely biological and drug addiction may turn out to be as well that doesn t mean it s ok most of us have particular things we tend to do wrong some people get angry easily others tend to be arrogant others tend to be attraced to women who are married to someone else homosexuality if we view it as wrong wouldn t be different than any of these other things if we are going to follow god we all end up at one time or another having to work to overcome bad habits and particular temptations that cause us problems none of us can sit back and say that because god made us the way we are we can just relax as jesus said we all have to take up our cross daily this concept of dying to self which also appears throughout paul s letters seems to suggest that there are going to be things about ourselves that we we are called on not to accept paul s letters and the experience of christians throughout history show us that sin is ingrained in us and the battle against it is lifelong and difficult the fact that homosexuality is difficult to fight doesn t necessarily say it s ok maybe this isn t the place where we have to die to self but i d like to make sure that those who think it isn t are fighting the battle somewhere else and not rejecting the concept that all christians have to fight against the deeply engrained habits of sin

 from mls panix com michael siemon subject re arsenokoitai nt meaning of organization panix public access internet stipulating paul s intent the immediate question is how can his readers understand this intent and following on that question there is a second one what is our proper action if we do manage to understand him since paul gives not a single clue about his meaning in the text of one st corinthians there are two positive answers and one negative to this question a paul or apollos or someone in the apostolic community has conveyed to the corinthians the then traditional jewish condem nation of homosexual behavior and paul expects them to be sufficiently well tutored by this tradition that he needs no futher explanation i should note that there is no evidence in the letter or in two corinthians for such a supposition b the spirit will teach us what paul means or if not paul what god means behind paul s inspired word choice c we don t know and cannot guess to within any better pre cision here than for comparison in the parallel use by paul in the same passage of the word pleonektai those who have more if you think that areseonkoitai is obvious from its roots try cutting your teeth on this word the neb translates it as grabbers or even methusoi drunkards at least this has the advantage of being a common insult so that at least there is some hint as to its meaning the three positions more or less if i can be allowed some exaggeration for the sake of argument define a classical catholic attitude towards tradition one form of protestant sola scriptura and a liberal critical demand for evidence all three positions have strengths and weaknesses ad a it is unquestionable that the gospel was preached in and by the community of christ s disciples and their successors and that our nt scripture itself emerges from this communal tradition but it s also the case that we know little or nothing about this tradition until almost a century after paul which is to say that we have access to the tradition only after several generations of possibly confused transmission the scripture is itself our only documentation of the tradition in the critical era ad b if we are not born of water and spirit to revert to john in an attempt to explain paul then we have no more hope of under standing the gospel than nicodemus had neither the traditions of men nor the vain elevation of our own reason can prevent the spirit from blowing where it will the paraclete is a kamikaze but the downside of protestant belief in the efficacy of the spirit as our guide in scripture is that the wing of protestantism that takes this most seriously is also the most fragmented over divergent understanding supposedly derived from the clear word of god note classical lutheran calvinist and anglican thought constrains scripture to be read within tradition even while reserving judgment against tradition out of scripture the more bizarre forms of i will read scripture my way are primarily a fringe aspect of cultic protestantism the main problem with this approach is that there is apparently no means for one person to convey to another what that one may feel is teaching received from the spirit and history shows incredible conflict between christians on this point each in his own mind convinced that he is led by the spirit no one can seriously urge point b without some sense of its potential for setting christian against christian to what purpose ad c the critical approach has the distinct advantage that when it can reach a conclusion it can lay out the data in a way which is open to all the weakness is an obvious corollary this is not usually possible if i may say a word here out of my own already acknowledged bias one complaint against critical methodology is that it dissolves faith but surely a faith that cannot honestly face the evalu ation of evidence has problems which mere theology is helpless to address anyway there is a serious and unfortunate possibility of schism between liberal and conservative positions mostly on the basis of extreme zealots of positions b and c a catholic sense of authority and tradition tends to constrain arguments of b contra c to secondary position so that despite horrendous strains rome is not as likely to find these issues as ultimately divisive as the protestant world will and anglicans will i predict muddle through on the via media attempting to give each position its due but no more than its due second question suppose tradition tells us and lots of spiritual christians tell us and critical thought at least admits as possible that paul is refering to a flat universal levitical prohibition against male male sex what then again we can abdicate our personal responsi bility to tradition and let it dictate the answer but it s precisely where inherited traditions are not questioned that they re most dangerous we have examples of christ questioning the pharisees and their use of tradition despite his urging in matthew two three two that we are to heed them we have examples of peter and more radically still paul jettisoning the traditions that they were led by the spirit to call into question jesus and peter and paul do not so much throw out tradition as subject it to radical criticism on a couple of very basic grounds the weightier demands of the law justice and mercy and good faith matthew two three two three and on these two commandments love god but if it does in fact come from god you will not only be unable to destroy them but you might find yourselves fighting against god acts five three six three nine all i ask is that you listen to your traditions and read your scriptures with a mind and soul open to the spirit and to the past history of our first christian witnesses willingness to challenge tradition and other readings of scripture though read with all the authority of scribes and rabbis and a submission to the declaration that all must depend on the love of god and neighbor then study the evidence learn the history of christians oppressing christians out of their traditions and eagerness to judge where jesus and paul tell us not to judge and let the witness

com most high all of you nevertheless or you shall die like men and fall mls ulysses att com like any prince psalm eight two six seven there s a certain ambiguity in your discussion of position a as to whether you re speaking of tradition in paul s time or ours i think there are two ways to use tradition one is to say that when paul and his readers share a tradition it makes sense to interpret his words in the context of that shared tradition that s what makes me think that these arguments over words turn out to be silly we know that paul came out of a background that was rather puritanical on sex everything else he says on sex is consistent with that background the tone of his remarks on homosexuality in rom one is consistent with that background even if the words in the sin lists aren t the most general terms for homosexual activity and it seems to me that there s some evidence that they are not they are just one more piece of evidence for something we would probably be willing to believe with no evidence at all that paul shares the common jewish rejection of homosexuality but when you identify a with the catholic position that s rather a horse of a different color the catholic position involves a continuing church tradition arguments specific to that tradition might be one we can get guidance on how to interpret paul s original meaning from tradition e g the way the church fathers interpreted him and two we gain confidence that his prohibitions still apply in our time because of the universal judgement of the church between his time and ours i think this is a somewhat different use of tradition a radical protestant might be willing to use known one st cent tradition to illuminate paul s original meaning but not use the catholic position to answer the question of what our own attitude to homosexuality should be clh

 from sun zero seven five gerry palo uunet uu net gerry palo subject re christianity and repeated lives lines one zero zero in article smayo world std com sc ott a mayo writes gerry palo writes there is nothing in christianity that precludes the idea of repeated lives on earth doesn t it say somewhere it is appointed to man once to die and then judgement i don t have a concordance here but i have some dim memory that this appears somewhere in the bible given a fairly specific context for what judgement is i d say that more or less decides the issue heb nine two seven clh indeed the immediate context nasb is two six otherwise he would have needed to suffer often since the foundation of the world but now once at the consummation he has been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself two seven and inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once and after this comes judgement two eight so christ also having been offered once to bear the sins of many shall appear a second time not to bear sin tro those who eagerly await him the first point is that this verse is part of an even larger context the subject of which is not the destiny of the individual human soul but rather the singular nature of christ s sacrifice once and the fulfillment of the law for all of fallen mankind rudolf frieling elaborates this in detail in his christianity and reincarnation the thrust of the passage in its context is to liken the one time incarnation and sacrifice of christ for all mankind to the individual experience of the human being after death the once is repeated and emphasized and it highlights the singularity of christ s deed one thing for certain it does is to refute the claims of some that christ incarnates more than once but the comparison to the human experience die once then judgement note not the judgement but just judgement the word for judgement is krisis hebrews nine two seven is the one passage most often quoted in defense of the doctrine that the bible denies reincarnation at this point i would just emphasize again that the passages that arguably speak against it are few and that invariably they are talking about something eles and the apparent denial of reincarnation is either inferred or as in the case of hebrews taken literally and deposited into an implied context namely a doctrine of the destiny of the human being after death what should be considered seriously is that the bible is essentially silent about the fate of the individual human being between death and the last day if you take the few passages that could possibly be interpreted to mean a single earth life they are arguable and there are other passages that point arguably in the other direc tion such as matthew one one one four and john nine two we can continue to debate the individual scraps of scripture that might have a bearinig on this and indeed we should discuss them but what i wanted to introduce into the discussion was an approach to the idea of repeated earth lives that unlike hindu buddhist and new age teachings takes full cognizance of the divinity singular incarnation death burial resurrection and second coming of christ as the savior of mankind the accountability of each individual for his deeds and the reality of the fall and of sin and its consequences the redemption of man from sin through christ the resurrection of the body and the last judgement taken in this larger sense many serious questions take on an entirely different perspective e g the destiny of those who died in their sins before christ came the relationship of faith and grace to works the meaning of deathbed conversion the meaning of the sacraments and many other things not that i propose to answer all those questions by a simple doctrine of convenience but only that the discussion takes on a different dimension and in my opinion one that is truly worthy of both man the earth and their creator and redeemer there are many deep questions that continue to be deep such as the meaning of the second death and how the whole of christian doctrine would apply to this larger perspective of human existence there are those who deeply believe that the things of which the bible does not speak are not things we should be concerned with but christ also indicated that there were other things that we would come to know in the future including things that his disciples and therefore others could not bear yet this idea that the human capacity for growth in knowledge not only of the individual in one lifetime but of the whole of humanity also takes on great meaning when we realize that our growth in the spirit is a long term process the bible was not meant to codify all spiritual knowledge in one place forever but to proclaim the gospel of the incarnation and redeeming deed of christ taking the gospel in the greater context from genesis to revelation now salvation healing becomes not the end of man s sojourn but its beginning and the last judgement and the new heaven and earth that follow it become its fulfullment gerry palo seven three two three seven two zero zero six compuserve com

will stop short of saying that unbaptised infants will go to hell it s very easy for just about anyone to come up with a partial list of scripture to support any sort of wrong doctrine however if we have the heart to persevere in our beliefs to make sure that they are biblically based then we can come to an understanding of the truth let s now take a more complete look at scripture colossians two one one one two in him you were also circumcised in the putting off of the sinful nature not with a circumcision done by christ having been buried with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the power of god who raised him from the dead in baptism we are raised to a new life in christ romans six four through a personal faith in the power of god our parent s faith cannot do this do infants have faith let s look at what the bible has to say about it romans one zero one six one seven but not all the israelites accepted the good news for isaiah says lord who has believed our message consequently faith comes from hearing the message and the message is heard through the word of christ so then we receive god s gift of faith to us as we hear the message of the gospel faith is a possible response to hearing god s word preached kids are not yet spiritually intellectually or emotionally mature enough to respond to god s word hence they cannot have faith and therefore cannot be raised in baptism to a new life ezekiel one eight two zero the soul who sins will die the son will not share the guilt of the father nor will the father share the guilt of the son the righteousness of the righteous man will be credited to him and the wickedness of the wicked will be charged against him if you read all of ezekiel one eight you will see that god doesn t hold us guilty for anyone else s sins so we can have no original guilt from adam ezekiel one eight three one three two rid yourselves of all the offenses you have committted and get a new heart and a new spirit why will you die o house of israel for i take no pleasure in the death of anyone declares the sovereign lord repent and live the way to please god is to repent and get a new heart and spirit kids cannot do this acts two three eight three nine says that when we repent and are baptized we will then receive a new spirit the holy spirit then we shall live now then that we have a little more background as to why original sin is not biblical let s look at some of the scriptures used to support it romans five one two therefore just as sin entered the world through one man and death through sin and in this way death came to all men because all sinned sin and death entered the world when the first man sinned death came to each man because each man sinned note that it s good to read through all of romans five one two two one some of the verses are easier to misunderstand than others but if we read them in context we will see that they are all saying basically the same thing let s look at one such romans five one nine for just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous through the disobedience of each individual each was made a sinner in the same way through the obedience of jesus each will be made righteous we must remember when reading through this passage that death came to each man only because each man sinned not because of guilt from adam otherwise the bible would contradict itself i encourage you to read through this whole passage on your own looking at it from this point of view to see if it doesn t all fit together psalm five one five surely i was sinful at birth sinful from the time my mother conceived me this whole psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble ourselves before god in repentance for sinning david himself was a man after god s own heart and wrote the psalm after committing adultry with bathsheba and murdering her husband all that david is saying here is that he can t remember a time when he wasn t sinful he is humbling himself before god by confessing his sinfulness his saying that he was sinful at birth is a hyperbole the bible being inspired by god isn t limited to a literal interpetation but also uses figures of speech as did jesus john one six two five for another example of hyperbole see luke one four two six now then even though people see that baptism requires faith and that original sin is not biblical they will still argue that infant baptism is necessary because children sin by being selfish not sharing toys with other children by being mean hitting others and fighting etc certainly we have observed children doing wrong things but my gut feeling is always that they don t know any better let s look to see if the bible agrees with my gut feelings isaiah seven one four one five therefore the lord himself will give you a sign the virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son and will call him immanuel he will eat curds and honey when he knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right now just about any church leader will tell you that this is a prophecy about jesus if they don t then point them to matthew one two three and find a new leader jesus certainly couldn t have had less knowledge than normal human babies yet this passage says that he had to mature to a certain extent before he would know the difference between right and wrong we see that he did grow and become wiser in luke two four zero and two five two the implication is that jesus did wrong things as a child before he knew to choose right over wrong since we know that jesus was perfect without sin we have rather conclusive proof that babies cannot sin because they don t know to choose the right instead of the wrong jesus himself was baptized albeit with john s baptism not as an infant but as a thirty year old man luke three two one two three and started his ministry as soon as he was baptized luke three two three immediately afterwards he was tempted by the devil luke four one one three matthew four one one one mark one one two one three thank you for your attention moderator this should finish up the subject for a while perhaps you would like to make a faq out of this response so that you can repost it from time to time when the topic comes up feel free to rearrange the contents if you would like to but please send me a copy of the final faq sincerely aaron cardenas aaronc athena mit edu i think you re overly optimistic about the authoritative quality of your response first original sin is not a catholic only doctrine it was held by luther and calvin as well and is still present in one form or another in the lutheran and reformed traditions second saying that it has no other purpose than defending infant baptism is an ad hominem argument which has considerable evidence against it the original baptist theology included original sin and some baptists still hold it and there are certainly groups that baptize infants without believing in original sin among protestants the sacraments tend to be a bit more symbolic than among catholics protestants who baptize infants see baptism as a sign of god s acceptance of us rather than our acceptance of god in traditional protestant theology god s grace precedes our response and is applicable to children there are a number of passages one can cite to indicate that god accepts even children clh

smith ministries a ministry dedicated to leading believers everywhere into a knowledge of the love of god if you would like more info on the ministry and or would like to comment on whether you found this teaching beneficial e mail to randy hunt at rlhunt hou amoco com love in the morning psalm nine zero one four by malcolm smith moses wrote this prayer at a weary time in the history of israel a generation before the time of its writing the people of israel had stood at kadesh gateway to canaan and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather than god s way they refused an adventure of faith in god which would have given them canaan the homeland of promise god honored their decision and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the land of promise until they were all buried in the sand the young decision makers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old and destined to be dead within forty years bleached bones in the desert by the time they were seventy eighty at the most the lives of these wanderers had been unending sadness moses described it as ending each year with a sigh v nine the fact that they knew give or take a few months when they were going to die underscored the meaninglessness of their existence whatever heights of success they reached they would be a heap of bleached bones within forty years the only ones to live outside of that depression of hopeless disbelief were joshua and caleb who had stood against the nation at kadesh and had god s promise of one day entering the land the forty year period was finally drawing to an end the new generation those who were children at kadesh were now grown and eager to take the inheritance their parents had refused to enjoy in the light of this moses prays it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over all these years as moses had walked with these moaning and complaining people through the wilderness of their exile he had carried a double burden his was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been but he also knew why they had chosen as they had at kadesh the problem was that they were ignorant of the character of their god if asked who is your god they would have described him as the god who is power when aaron had created their concept of god in an idol he chose a calf or young bull a symbol of power of virility in their minds god was the young bull who had impaled pharaoh on his horns and gored egypt s gods as he led israel to sinai but when man worships a god of power his miracles grow thin and even boring after miracle food on the desert floor and water gushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland the god of almightiness becomes ho hum what s next on the miracle menu and a god of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf he might be all they need but then who knows if he has all power he has a right to do whatever he wants whenever he wants the only person these people had known who had absolute power was pharaoh and men s lives had hung on the whim of his moods which could change with the wind they believed god could work his wonders on their behalf but they did not know him and so could not trust him israel had a god based on what he did his acts moses knew the heart of god the motivation behind the acts from the day of his encounter at the burning bush moses had been fascinated by god at sinai he asked to be shown his glory to know who he really was he had seen what god had done he wanted to know who god was this request was granted and moses was given a glimpse of god s glorious person he had come to know the heart of god as compassion and lovingkindness exodus three four six seven the word lovingkindness is not to be understood as a human kind of love it speaks of the kind of relationship arising out of the making of a covenant it can only be understood as the love that says i will never leave you nor forsake you lovingkindness is as tenacious as a british bulldog when the world walks out this love digs in its heels and refuses to leave and it is not human romantic love based on feelings and rooted in emotions it is a love of covenant commitment and therefore operates quite apart from feelings god s love is not an emotion that wavers day by day it is the total commitment of his being to seek our highest and best and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans god does not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses his feelings of love toward us we do not woo him and cause him to fall in love with us if that were the case the first ugly sinful thing we did would cause him to reject us he is love and he loves us because of who he is not because of who we are he does not love what we do but he is committed to us pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness he will not let us go his is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us but a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us it is saying to the recipient for as long as we shall live i am for you the god who has revealed himself to man through scripture and finally in jesus in his coming and in his death and resurrection is the god who is lovingkindness thus he loves us and gives himself to us he will never leave us nor forsake us tragically many believers have never seen him as love they see him as power no one will come to faith by just seeing miracles miracles point to who he is and that is when faith springs in the heart israel did not see god as lovingkindness they saw his acts of power moses knew his ways the kind of god he was and the love that he had for these people because of their total lack of understanding of his love they could not trust him to be their strength in taking the land faith is born out of knowing the love he has for us it is the resting response to the one who gives himself to us he is not the force and to call him the almighty is to miss his heart he is love who is the almighty and the infinite force if man is to make force or raw power work for him he must depend on knowing the forrnula and have faith in it but the power that issues from love demands faith in the person of love himself the forty years of meaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to know the god of love at this point with the new generation and the possibility of enjoying all that god promised moses prays verse one four the language moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its mother s love now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes it is waking to the consciousness of being loved watched over cared for protected fed and cleaned day and night by the mother suppose we were to ask what has the baby done to deserve this or have arrangements been made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience our questions would be considered unnatural even immoral the child was conceived in love anticipated and prepared for with love s excitement a love that has been to the gates of death to bring it into being the parents love is unconditional spontaneous it has nothing to do with the looks of the child or its performance so god is love he loves us unconditionally spontaneously we were conceived in his imagination and fashioned after his image to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the lord jesus it is slanderous and immoral to even ask what we must do to earn and deserve that love the child discovers its personhood and identity through the eyes and touch through the cuddles of its parents love it is a scientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or if it survives will have severe emotional problems and a person who has been held and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the embrace and knowledge of love from god moses prays that the new generation will learn to wake every morning resting with total confidence in the love of god and will receive all his promises and blessings with joy and gladness significantly moses prays that they will be satisfied with his love satisfied in the hebrew language is a rich picture word describing being filled with an abundance of gourmet food it is also used to describe the earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received enough water moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be drenched in the life giving love of god that sense of satisfaction is the lifelong quest of every man and woman when we are satisfied in our deepest selves many of our emotional and even our physical problems disappear man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling that he is fulfilled as a human being his hours have meaning which make sense out of the ordinary and mundane apart from god man seeks this satisfaction through intellectual pursuit through the exciting of the emotions and through the feeding of his body he will even seek it in religious exercise but man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding to the love of the living god only in knowing god s love will the rest of life make sense as the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again became the inheritance to be taken moses prayed this psalm i find it fascinating that he should pray and ask god for a daily revelation of his love considering the awe with which the people held moses one would think he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and by the knowledge they gained they would live in it but moses knew better god is the only one who can make known to us his love we won t find it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to manipulate him nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and give us god feelings it is god himself the lover who must open our eyes and satisfy us with his love this prayer is man in helplessness asking god to make the love he is real in our hearts moses prayer was partially answered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which worked by love in the book of judges but it would not be answered in its fullest dimensions until the coming of the holy spirit who pours out the love of god in our hearts romans five five in the history of the early church we read of the holy spirit falling upon the believers this is an ancient expression that in modern english means to give a bear hug it is used in luke one five to describe the father running to the prodigal and falling on his neck and kissing him the holy spirit is god hugging you in your deepest self and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your being this is not a one time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes moses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization that we are loved the world and much of our religious training has taught us to perform in order to be accepted we have spent far too long living in a state of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves to find acceptance and love from others and from god we now come humbled to receive love we cannot earn to be still and let him tell us we are loved to let the holy spirit descend into us pouring out the love of god we come in stillness to think on and repeat his words of love to our minds which have been jaded with the doctrine of perform to be accepted we begin to realize that he loves us as we are and gives meaning and purpose to all of life i challenge everyone reading this to begin each day from the moment you open your eyes by celebrating the god of love and praying this prayer you may not feel anything but something always happens i was x rayed the other day i did not see or feel anything but i noted that the technicians kept behind protective walls they know you cannot be exposed to those rays without being affected so it is as we consciously begin our day knowing that we are loved such experiential knowledge will produce according to moses joy and gladness all our days joy is the result of a life that is functioning as god intended us to function when he made us you might say that joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance man s highest performance is to rest in the love god has for him the hum will be joy and the result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now has in life stop wandering in the wilderness be satisfied with his love and in joy day by day receive all his promised blessings end included message

 from rick granberry pts mot com rick granberry subject boston c of c reply to rick granberry pts mot com rick granberry organization motorola paging and telepoint systems group lines two six three note the following article is submitted on behalf of someone frank daniels who has difficulty posting to s r c email replies to daniels math ufl edu i am unable to post to the bitnet groups here is a capsule history of the shepherding discipleship movement in the churches of christ i e crossroads boston i could trace the movement back as far as one eight zero zero and indeed some of its roots go back that far but these were really influences on the movement and not the actual movement per se i will start in c one nine two zero in that day there were white churches and colored churches in nearly every area due to segregation modern pentecostalism was developing as a predominantly colored phenomenon here there was great fanaticism emphasis on emotional experiences and belief in a personal guidance and indwelling of the holy spirit many white protestant churches were growing into what became known as conservative fundamentalism by the one nine four zero s the evangelical movement was in full swing and many groups were becoming part of it when the civil rights movement grew stronger in the one nine five zero s and one nine six zero s many white church groups began to be influenced by the black churches and by what was going on there this spread started in the most liberal of groups and spread to the more conservative ones by the late six zero s in one nine six nine even the catholic church was displaying evidence of influence by the other groups still evident today the churches of christ are and were a very conservative protestant group when the influence from outside began to reach the cofc in c one nine six five it was generally not appreciated conservative groups are very strongly resistant to change and the new movement was very different from the cofc status quo the magazines put out at that time by cofc folks tell the story as it unfolds new ideas came into the cofc there was a big push to reach out to college students young adults and teens some called this the campus evangel ism movement emotions generally not highly regarded in the cofc at large played a more important role in the new movement in some places people began to speak in tongues as their pentecostal predecessors did this was met with extreme criticism from within the churches of christ in some places people were fired from their jobs for speaking in tongues or for advocating the holy spirit movement another name for the new branch the term underground church of christ also came into use because these people had to hide their differences or they might be ostricised there were several congregations however whose leaderships were receptive to the new ideas at least in part the tongues speaking never really caught on one of these was the one four th street church of christ in gainesville fl campus ministry had already been regarded as important at one four th street and the new ideas seemed to be very helpful tools for evangelism they also seemed to put vitality into the church which many felt had been lacking in october of one nine six seven the one four th street congregation hired chuck lucas to be its campus minister by one nine seven zero he would move to being the congregation s lead minister in the late six zero s early seven zero s the congregation worked with many other groups they held bible discussions at daytona beach during spring break they organized talks in the fraternities on the university of florida campus they also worked with uf sports people in one nine seven two the congregation ordered a larger building to be constructed when it was finished the group moved and changed its name now no longer appropriate it became the crossroads church of christ from then on a name that would become legendary by this time crossroads was basically the only cofc whose programs were fully aligned to the new movement while they didn t start it they continued it and were responsible for where it wound up going by one nine seven five none of the other churches of christ in the area felt that they could cooperate with crossroads due to what they recognized as doctrinal problems at crossroads crossroads had begun to heavily emphasize and later require attendance at all church functions it was seen as a good thing for each member to have at least one close relationship a person with whom you would share all of your problems pray and get help from the concept was called prayer partners which later became discipleship partners and also later became mandatory the leadership was assigning prayer partners to people for a while the book called the master plan of evangelism was a strong influence on chuck lucas he and the group believed that it was every person s duty and life purpose to carry out the great commission crossroads was growing in number and numbers became very important some would say all important a person who was evangelistic was spiritual evangelism meant inviting people to crossroads events if you did this a lot and some of them converted then you were spiritual there were sermons about how if you bought groceries the cashier and bag boy ought to receive invitations to services everyone at your job ought to receive invitations since these people needed jesus you should be aggressive don t take no for an answer if you did not evangelize enough you came to be called lazy or unspiritual by the end of the decade the prayer partner system was integrated into a structure the elders and ministers were on top like a big pyramid then the group leaders bible study leaders and members everyone who came in had someone placed over them it is at this time one nine seven eight one nine eight zero that the bad press about crossroads began to circulate the problem with rape on the university of florida campus was tremendous but crossroads was considered a bigger and more immediate problem there were many complaints about the congregation and its pushy evangelistic tactics crossroads was considering the other churches of christ to be dead churches which aggravated them it was aggressively recruiting out of the other church groups denominations which aggravated them by this time crossroads had grown numerically to the point one one zero zero where not only did they believe that they would soon need a new building but also they were sending out planting create a new church and reconstructing reorganize an existing church teams to other cities by this time the crossroads movement was underway a group was sent to the three zero member lexington church of christ in boston ma the team was headed up by kip mckean who had been converted out of a fraternity by crossroads in gainesville kip held a still stronger view of church authority which he believed was heavily vested in the evangelist s and not so much in the elders he had been fired in one nine seven seven from the congregation that he had been working at when the elders there found numerous things wrong with his theology including the practice of what came to be called one over one christianity called this by critics in the first year half of the three zero people felt that they did not want to be a part of the new congregation they left but others began coming into the new boston church of christ ah but i m ahead of myself at crossroads the heavy handed system had begun to take its toll on the members many have said that they felt that they were working hard but they were not achieving the results that were so important the numbers were dropping from one nine seven eight crossroads membership declined steadily the leadership began to tighten the reigns on the congregation who was seen as being largely unproductive and unfruitful the fruit passages in the nt were interpreted as referring to new converts if you were not bearing fruit said john one five you would be cast into the fire boston still teaches this if you love your neighbor you ll save his soul invite him to church and convert him if you re not doing that you don t love your neighbor and if you don t love you re in danger of backsliding the logical arguments continue in this vein in one nine eight five chuck lucas was fired from his job as minister due to recurring sins in his life these struggles were never revealed to the congregation at large although many people outside the congregation had heard about them for by now there was very little contact on a friendship level between most crossroads members and those outside if you have contact your focus should be on converting them bring them to a bible study chuck s replacement was joe woods who was fully supportive of the boston system as boston grew in number they began to offer training sessions for other ministers joe went to boston to be trained and returned to cross roads ready to emphasize the total commitment to the church that boston and kip mckean were now emphasizing eventually in fall of one nine eight seven the elders at crossroads now two in number dick whitehead and bill hogle made a decision boston was demanding that all of the other churches in the movement come under the direction of the church in boston the elders refused citing their belief that each church should be autonomous something true in all non boston churches of christ perhaps there was also some degree of offense done here since crossroads was no longer the example to the rest of the movement the group now numbered about eight zero zero while boston was now larger in membership the churches of christ generally teach that baptism is a necessary element of salvation at crossroads they taught what was called lordship baptism you had to understand the commitment involved before you could be baptized you had to count the cost at boston they took this a step further if at some time you became unproductive then your spirituality was suspect people would begin to ask you if you really understood what you were getting into anyone who said no had their baptism deemed invalid they hadn t counted the cost properly they still had to be baptized others called this rebaptism and crossroads didn t approve of this practice when crossroads announced that it would not follow boston many of its members left crossroads and went to movement related ministries which were now called discipling ministries you were either discipling evangelizing or you were dead they also used the nickname movement of god for a while by summer of one nine eight eight crossroads was withdrawn from the movement and now stood alone they had few to no allies in the mainstream churches of christ and now none in the movement boston however continued to chart its course in the direction that they had been following they sent reconstruction teams to many cities which usually meant that they split the church there they stopped acknowledging other churches of christ as christians and began to call themselves the remnant the remnant of the jews in the ot are those who are saved by god it was felt that the remnant today represents all the christians sometimes they would simply call their movement the church they usually took the name of the city for their name implying to the other churches of christ that boston did not recognize their existence many campuses have now formally forbidden boston ministries from recruiting there due to the number of complaints in some cases it has been documented that boston ministries have lied to university officials in order to continue to have access to the campus any resistance that they experience is termed perse cution which all true christians are expected to experience are you really a christian if you re not being persecuted the numbers at boston peaked at c three zero zero zero in one nine eight nine since then they have fought to remain steady i have heard a tape of kip mckean shouting at the leaders for failing to fulfill the great commission their life s purpose as god commanded them their christianity is highly centered on commands and obedience crossroads once was called a cult boston is now recognized by the cult awareness network and other national and international groups as a cult under a formal definition because of the techniques which they employ the term cult is usually differentiated from sect by the practice of those techniques the techniques which they employ are recognized by many as being techniques of destructive pursuasion also used by other shepherding discipleship groups robert jay lifton margaret thaler singer and many others have written about the

to grind against the movement i have numer ous friends who are still part of the movement i have never had a falling out with anyone in the movement i disagree with many things which they teach i recognize the psychological damage done by being involved in such a system i hold no loyalty to the mainstream churches of christ and do not defend their mistakes either i want to point out though that unlike in many other systems which are in other ways similar the leadership of the boston movement are as much victims of the system as the members we do not have a leader who enjoys manipulating his people the leaders believe what they teach and they feel accountable for the activites and spiritual welfare of the members when members do not evangelize to their expectations for example the leaders feel personally responsible as well the leaders are not out for money or power they want to evangelize the world in their lifetime i have said too much but there is much more to say there are many examples i could give and quotes from other sources including boston bulletins that i could include but this is too long already you may post this if you so desire frank d answer not a fool

 from mls panix com michael siemon subject re arsenokoitai nt meaning of organization panix public access internet unix nyc lines two one zero conviction of sin a meta exegetical or methodological essay in article rexlex fnal fnal gov writes i can t post it all at once so it will come piece meal and not daily i look forward to reading it when i got to the library last week it was with the object in view to look at some articles that have appeared over the last few years since my previous look at the literature un fortunately they had moved the journal back issues so i didn t get a look at the articles i was hoping to find i will continue to reserve my own judgment on arsenokoitai until i have seen the latest scholarly work and i can hope that rexlex s posting may give some meat to chew on however what i can do now is to point out the methodological issues what needs to be shown for anything to be concluded in this matter if the article rexlex posts addresses these issues so much the better if not you will perhaps understand why the problem is hard james b deyoung writes in abstractu this study argues that paul coined the term arsenokoitai deriving it from the lxx of lev two zero one two cf one eight two two and using it for homosexual orientation and behavior it is only a minor point but let me make it anyway de young has already contradicted his own prior assertion in this abstract that the ancient analysis of these issues was concerned with actions and not with orientation i doubt this will have much bearing on the article as such but thought i should point it out from the start the hypothesis de young is advancing is that paul a coined the word and b his intended meaning for it was in reference to the levitical law the questions i wish to raise are one how would one go about confirming the truth of this hypothesis and two what follows if one accepts or stipulates for the sake of the discussion that it is correct note that b is independent of a i consider b far more plausible than a which seems merely to be a counsel of despair over finding nothing in the literature contemporary with paul to clarify this word so far as i know paul does not in general invent words anywhere else in his letters unless you have an otherwise established pattern of coinages it is not sound methodology to assume it particularly if he gives no hint in the immedi ate text to fix the coinage s meaning for his audience as yet the extract presents no evidence at all what do we need to confirm or reject the hypothesis which i should say at the outset i find somewhat plausible i certainly know of nothing which makes it an impossible way of construing this problem passage i m going to set aside for the moment the question of whether paul might have coined this usage to look at the more tractable question of what it means for this there are in principle two kinds of evidence that can be adduced internal and external that is we can look at the text of paul s letter for clarification or look outside that to prior or contemporary writings that paul might have relied on or to derivative writings that have some claim of access to paul s meaning the single worst problem with this word in corinthians is that there is no internal evidence for paul s meaning he uses the word totally without an explanation or hint as to his meaning save that its inclusion in a list of negatives implies that it has for him some negative meaning we are left as the only internal clue with the etymology or formation of the word which is indeed the reason that de young and others before him have associated it with the leviticus prohibition of men verbing with other men where verb is some standard euphemism for having sex lie in leviticus bed in greek one problem is that bedders koitai is not as far as i know used that way in greek therefore i offer one serious test which de young s hypothesis must pass or be rejected o find a body of greek texts contemporary with paul or not much prior to his day such that the x koitai formation implies men who have sex with x obviously the best case is to find such usages of arsenokoitai itself such texts would be confirmation that the word can be read that way it is worth emphasizing that compound words are not in general under standable by projecting what the reader may imagine by the juxtaposition of the roots existence of such parallels doesn t prove the hypothesis correct but it goes a long way towards making such a usage whether or not original with paul in the specific case of x arse n possible of comprehension by his readers my test moves in the direction of external evidence if paul does not in his text explain his word and he does not then he has to expect his readers to already know the word which stands against its being a coinage or to expect that it mimics word formations that they do know such that they can guess his meaning without too much floundering external evidence that is texts other than paul s own and lexicographic or social historical considerations that might be adduced then come into the picture if there are other uses of the word not dependent on paul which have sufficient internal contextual evidence or some gloss by a contemporary scribe to show a derogatory reference to male homosexu ality or similar koitai formations used in similar ways then one has grounds for o denying that paul coined the word and o assuming that his readers might understand his meaning do you see the problem if paul coined the word then he requires his readers to share enough context with him to comprehend his coinage and its intent in this case that they would stipulating de young s guess understand him to be referring to the levitical universal prohibition of male male sex this mind you in a context where paul has emphasized at least to other congregations and so one assumes to the corinthians how else to explain one cor six one two and the corinthians having to be pulled back from overinterpreting their freedom the non applicability of torah law to his gentile converts among the considerations that make it implausible for paul to have coined the word its first element is archaic arse n is an old attic or ionic form of what in even classical let alone koine times would be assimilated as arre n to me this implies that we are even more than usually needful of external evidence to pin down meaning and usage what is paul doing inventing a word in obsolete attic formation and if he didn t coin the word but picked it up like the others in his list as common terms of derogation then his meaning will be for his readers constrained by that common meaning since he gives no other i cannot emphasize enough that paul does not tell us what he means by this word we and his original readers are guessing they at least had a contemporary context and maybe paul had used this very word and explained it in great detail to them in person but we have no trace of evidence of that and to suppose it is mere fantasy so we are desperately in need of external evidence about this word and it seems to be exceptionally meagre that is precisely the problem i can think of several more or less equally plausible hypotheses about the word a it was a standard gutter term of abuse for some or all maybe very specific maybe very general homosexual male activities b it was a term of abuse used by jews about the awful homosexual greeks which may or may not be consciously associated on their part with the leviticus passage c paul invented the term and again there may or may not be an association with leviticus in his doing so he may or may not intend the word to have an explicit and universal application with absolute and clear boundaries since none of his other words in that list have such character this last seems to me about the least plausible of the hypotheses i m advancing of these i d say off the top of my head that a is most plausible but i still have reservations about that too if the word never appears before paul and in later uses has some evidence of depending on paul then one can opt for paul s coining it if it does appear before him he might still have coined it being unaware of prior use in which case his coinage is inherently confusing but one should normally demote c on the basis of any earlier uses especially if they can be shown to have been at all common in the places paul traveled in either of the a or b cases one has to take into account paul s relation to the community of usage he picked the word up from and whether it be from the greek or jewish communities paul s relations are hardly straight forward there is so far as i have yet seen little or no external evidence to aid us in selecting one of these or some other hypothesis your guess is as good as mine or maybe worse or maybe better depending on a lot of things but it remains so far guesswork and i don t know about you but i for one will not equate human guesswork with the will of god by all means be convinced in your own conscience about what paul is getting at as he says elsewhere on what was in his day a major controversy of somewhat this same character romans one four two two two three hold on to your own belief as between yourself and god and consider the man fortunate who can make his decision without going against his conscience but anybody who eats in a state of doubt is condemned because he is not in good faith and every act done in bad faith is a sin for my part i cannot see any way to resolve paul s meaning in the use of arsenokoitai without directly applicable external evidence and by the nature of such external evidence it will never reach to certainty of constraining paul s own intent paul like humpty dumpty and me and all the rest of us will use words in ways that are personal choices and sometimes leave his readers puzzled if that puzzlement leads you to god it may be blessed if it should lead away as some of paul s words have led some people then paul s intense communicative effort to contrive his meaning in our souls may have some regretable consequences i have always found paul to be a fantastically reliable guide if i read him in the large if i can see him lay out his position in detail and hammer it home time and time again i am much less certain about his meaning in his many brief and cryptic passages such as this one in my usual discursive way i have gone on at great length about the first of my intended meta exegetical points what would be needed to confirm that paul a coined or b in any case meant the word to mean the same as the leviticus prohibition my second point is to stipulate this hypo thesis and follow up what it implies for both his initial

 from djohnson cs ucsd edu darin johnson subject re homosexuality issues in christianity organization cse dept u c san diego lines three three any attempts to make homosexuals feel unwelcome because of our discomfort with homosexuality is incompatible with christianity is our hatred so deep that rather than see someone try to become closer to jesus we need to keep them away this is too often true many people try to place this as a higher sin however does jesus need us to screen out those guilty of a particular sin do we really mistrust jesus when he says he can forgive any sin a big part of the problem is that many of the homosexuals and people advocating acceptance of homosexuality in churches do not consider active homosexuality a sin i don t often see the attitude of forgive me and i will try to change instead i see there s nothing wrong with my life and i can be a good christian so it must be you who have an illness because you don t accept me christians can and will accept homosexuals just as they will accept any sinner sure it may be natural to some people to be homosexual but it is also perfectly natural for everyone to sin i was born with a desire to sin but i work to prevent myself from sinning it s much less common now but i still have urges to lash out in anger there also may not be a sudden disappearance of sinful desires or ever so it is sad to see people leave the church when they are discouraged that they are still homosexual after several years darin johnson djohnson ucsd edu particle man particle man doing the things a particle can

 from poram mlsma att att com subject re deuterocanonicals esp sirach organization at t lines one two three andrew continuing the discussion on the deuterocanonicals in article revdak netcom com d andrew kille writes poram ihlpb att com wrote lets talk about principles if we accept that god sets the standards for what ought to be included in scripture then we can ask one is it authoritative authoritative is not a quality of the writing itself it is a statement by the community of faith whether it will accept the writing as normative arguably it is both since authority is a matter of both communicator and recepiant we can say that for example jesus is lord whether the world at large accepts the authority or not thus the bible can be considered for its authoritative content whether or not it is accepted this issue is at the heart of pilate s pragmatic question what is truth to jesus when our lord was brought before him jesus reply was to appeal to the authority of his father you also might like to consider the claimed authority represented by the statements thus says the lord in the bible which claim to put across the exact words of god you fall into the danger of relativism with your rejection of inherant authority and claim that it lies only in the community of faith does something become truth because it is accepted the main thrust of my argument is that there is a godward direction as well as a manward which is where the reference to rev two two came in two is it prophetic how is prophecy to be defined if it is speaking forth of god s message much of the apocrypha must surely qualify if we narrowed it down to the predictive elements which will cut out some of the three nine accepted ot books as well we nonetheless have criteria for determining the validity of the book jesus standards were that scripture cannot be broken can you name a single prophecy that fits the bill in the apocrapha ie definitely fulfilled after it has been written three is it authentic again by what standard is authenticity a function of the authors the historical accuracy does it have a subjective ring of truth about it and does other evidence that has come to light contradict or confirm the authenticity archaeological other textual evidence for example four is it dynamic what is this supposed to mean many of the apocryphal books are highly dynamic thought provoking faithful even exciting what this is getting at is the relationship between text and reader it is to do with the quality of writing which should have the ability to fire the mind affect our thought life and cause us to act in a certain way there is something of this in jesus quote man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of the lord matt four four five is it received collected read and used by whom of course the apocryphal books were received by some collected or else we would not have them read and used and they still are in the catholic and orthodox churches does the catholic church give the same authority to the apocrapha as to the accepted six six books certainly it is not as widely used as the ot and nt on these counts the apocrapha falls short of the glory of god this is demonstrably false think about what i have said above you may want to revise your conclusion in addition think about other sacred writings eg the koran the book of mormon and how and why you would categorise them using the above principles one word of caution you may find some reflected glory in some of these books in that the inspired quality may be derived from the bible remember that lucifer is quite capable of appearing as an angel of light and quoting scripture to quote unger s bible dictionary on the apocrapha one they abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and anachronisms so do other books of the bible what were you thinking of deletions how do you then view the words i warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book if anyone adds anything to them god will add to him the plagues described in this book and if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy god will take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the holy city rev two two one eight nine surely this sets the standard and not just man made traditions these words clearly were meant to refer to the book of revelation alone not to the whole body of scripture revelation itself was accepted very late into the canon the church simply did not see it as having a primary role of any kind in identifying and limiting scripture we ve lost the point and the context here i am not arguing that the statement in rev can be applied indescriminately just that the whole acceptance rejection idea does not just follow on from man made traditions but there is i believe an act of god involved in the selection and criteria of what is classified as scripture and comes under the definition of two tim three one six revdak netcom com barney resson

 from mls panix com michael siemon subject re homosexual issues in christianity organization panix public access internet unix nyc lines one six four in article mserv mozart cc iup edu someone named mark writes mls panix com michael siemon writes homosexual christians have indeed checked out these verses some of them are used against us only through incredibly perverse interpretations others simply do not address the issues i can see that some of the above verses do not clearly address the issues there are exactly zero verses that clearly address the issues however a couple of them seem as though they do not require incredibly perverse interpretations in order to be seen as condemning homosexuality the kind of interpretation i see as incredibly perverse is that applied to the story of sodom as if it were a blanket equation of homosexual behavior and rape since christians citing the bible in such a context should be presumed to have at least read the story it amounts to slander a charge that homosexuality rape to use that against us do not be deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers nor effeminate nor homosexuals nor thieves nor the covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor swindlers shall inherit the kingdom of god and such were some of you i cor six nine one one the moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of porneia in this i think we can all agree with paul that there are some kinds of activity that could be named by fornication or theft or coveting or reviling or drunkenness which would well deserve condemnation we may or may not agree to the bounds of those categories however and the very fact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at all clear but that paul an excellent rhetorician had no interest in making them clear leaving matters rather to our spirit led decisions with all the uncomfortable living with other readings that has dominated christian discussion of all these areas homosexual behavior is no different i and the other gay christians i know are adamant in condemning rape heterosexual or homosexual and child molestation heterosexual or homosexual and even the possibly harmless but obsessive kinds of sex heterosexual or homosexual that would stand condemned by paul in the very continuation of the chapter you cite may i mildly suggest that what paul does in his letter that you want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning i am free to do anything you say yes but not everything is for my good no doubt i am free to do anything but i for one will not let anything make free with me one cor six one two which is a restatement that we must have no other god before god a commandment neither i nor any other gay christian wishes to break some people are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior it is just as wrong though slightly less incendiary so it s a secondary argument from the phobic contingent to equate homosexuality with such behavior as to equate it with the rape of god s messengers i won t deal with the exegesis of leviticus except very tangentially fundamentally you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your assumption that you know what porneia means there are plenty of laws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in leviticus most of which christians ignore completely they never even bother to examine them they just assume that they know which ones are moral and which ones are ritual well i have news for you any anthropology course should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs unlcean as categories in an awful lot of societies we have them too but buried pretty deep and i cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of leviticus from the ritual law which no christian i know feels applies to us i m dead serious here when people start going on as they do in this matter about how repulsive and unnatural our acts are and what do they know about it huh it is a solid clue to the same sort of arbitrary cultural inculcations as the american prejudice against eating insects on what basis other than assuming your conclusion can you say that the law against male male intercourse in leviticus is not a part of the ritual law for those christians who do think that some parts of leviticus can be law for christians while others are not even to be thought about it is incumbent on you in every case handled on its own merits to determine why you pick one and ignore another i frankly think the whole effort misguided reread paul no doubt i am free to do anything but christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this the great commandment of love for god and neighbor if you cannot go through leviticus and decide each command there on that basis then your own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy in this context it is remarkably offensive to say i notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse well la ti da so what this is almost as slimey an argument as the one that homosexuality rape i know of no one who argues seriously though one can always find jokers in defense of bestiality it is absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay christians do raise which concern sexual activity within committed consensual human adult realtionships so that your bringing it up is no more relevant than the laws of kashrut if you cannot address the actual issues you are being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the world if you want to address bestiality that is your business not mine and attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in our culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing us as human beings you want to dismiss us and use the sleaziest means you can think of to do so jesus and paul both expound very explictly and in considerable length the central linch pin of christian moral thought we are required to love one another and all else depends on that gay and lesbian christ ians challenge you to address the issue on those terms and all we get in return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side track the issues christians no doubt very sincere ones keep showing up here and in every corner of usenet and the world and all they ever do is spout these same old verses which they obviously have never thought about maybe never even read in total ignorance of the issues raised slandering us with the vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can manage to conjure up tossing out red herrings with they suppose great emotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even taking the trouble to find out what it is such behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen truth in christ why for god s precious sake do you people quote irrelevant verses to condemn people you don t know and won t even take the trouble to listen to before you start your condemnations is that loving your neighbor god forbid is that how you obey the repeated commands to not judge or condemn others christ and paul spend orders of magnitude more time in insisting on this than the half dozen obscure words in paul that you are so bloody ready to take as license to do what god tells you not to do why for god s sake for god did not send the son into the world to condemn the world but that the world might be saved through him whoever believes in him is not condemned but whoever does not believe has already been condemned for refusing to believe in the name of god s only son now the judgment is this the light has come into the world but men have preferred darkness to light because their deeds were evil for everyone who practices wickedness hates the light and does not come near the light for fear his deeds will be exposed but he who acts in truth comes into the light so that it may be sh zero own that his deeds are done in god john three one seven two

 from hudson athena cs uga edu paul hudson jr subject re homosexual issues in christianity organization university of georgia athens lines three eight in article mls panix com michael siemon writes i notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse it is absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay christians do raise which concern sexual activity within committed consensual human adult realtionships so that your bringing it up is no more relevant than the laws of kashrut if you cannot address the actual issues you are being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the world no it is very relevant homosexual acts and acts of beastiality are topically aranged together in the law this is very important anyone who would want to say that this command against homosexuality deals with temple prostitution and i think you would agree that there is no proof for this if the law reveals the character of god and is holy just and good as is written in the new testament then those who consider we who are against commiting homosexuals acts to be biggots have to address this passage of scripture why must we only discuss scriptures that involve consensual human adult relationships isn t that bordering on sophistry the point we are making is that god did not ordain certain kinds of sex acts not everyone who brings up these scriptures is just trying to use and emotional argument that compares homosexuals to beastophiles and child molestors the issue we are dealing with is that some sex acts are ungodly i do not have problem with a loving nonlustful relationship with a member of the same sex i have them and we all do the issue at hand is the sinfulness having sex with members of the same sex or lusting after so other forbidden sex acts are a valid topic for conversation and the idea that these relationships may be emotional relationships between adult humans is red herring we all agree that it is okay for adults to have caring relationships with one another link hudson

the year four zero zero it is the most ancient witness we possess as to the principal parts of the roman canon which only appear in the sacramentaries some time after the seventh century the question as to whether the roman canon is not older even than that of de sacramentis is discussed by liturgiologists mgr batiffol is of this opinion but we on the contrary think that the former bears traces of closer composition of a more carefully guarded orthodoxy and that consequently it is a text corrected from de sacramentis we shall see in studying the list of names in the memento of the living and that of the dead that mgr batiffol argues with good reason that he can date these fragments from the pontificate of symmachus four nine eight five one four we thus have the state of the roman mass or at least of the chief parts of the canon at the beginning of the fourth century

completely new to me and i thought i d offer it for comment to keep this as brief as possible let me state my observation as a declarative statement and then whoever wants to can comment on it basically what i think i ve observed is that the phrase the ten commandments as used by moses is not a reference to ex two zero one one seven but rather a reference to ten distinct discourses from ex two zero one through ex three one one eight that is the phrase the ten commandments should more accurately be translated the ten discourses of which the passage we call the ten commandments is really only the first i m not completely convinced that the above is true but for purposes of discussion let me argue it as though i was sure arguments supporting the above idea one there aren t really ten commandments in ex two zero one one seven in order to get one zero commandments you have to get two of them out of verses three six and the verses themselves do not support such a division because they are all about not worshipping other gods that is verse three commands to have no other gods and verse five commands to not worship the idols mentioned in verse four you can t violate verses five six without violating verse three indicating that the whole passage is one command and leaving us with only nine commandments i could go on at length about this but for now i ll just stop with this summary two there are ten speeches between ex two zero one the beginning of the traditional ten commandments and ex three one one eight where god actually gives moses the two tablets with the ten commandments discourses written on them i break these ten down as follows two zero one one seven two zero two two two six two one one two three three three two five one three zero one zero three zero one one one six three zero one seven two one three zero two two three three three zero three four three eight three one one one one and three one one two one eight in most cases each of these passages begins with some variation of the phrase and the lord spoke to moses saying the exception is ex two one one which begins now these are the ordinances which you are to set before them three the word translated commandments in the phrase the ten commandments isn t really the word for commandment its the word for a speech or an utterance it s a word often used for longer discourses rather than individual statements for instance when combined with the word yom day this word is translated chronicles in such phrases as now the rest of the acts of so and so are they not written in the chronicles of x the word for commandment is freely used throughout the books of moses and perhaps it is significant that when moses spoke of the ten x s he appears to have avoided the word for commandment and chosen instead a word associated with discourses longer than just a single command four god tells moses that he is going to give him the stone tablets with the law and the commandments ex two four one two yet he does not give moses the tablets until he has finished all ten discourses on mount sinai if the ten commandments were only ex two zero one one seven it is not immediately clear why god would wait several days and nine more discourses before giving these tablets to moses on the other hand if we have the ten discourses written on the tablets then it makes perfect sense that god would not give moses the tablets until he had finished delivering all ten discourses five when moses did get the tablets he found that both tablets were written on both sides ex three two one five if these ten commandments were only the first one seven verses of ex two zero god would have had to have written in large letters not that he couldn t have of course but it does seem more likely to me that this is a reference to two tablets containing ten discourses written in normal sized letters six in ii cor three paul seems to specifically single out the commandments written on stone as being the ministry of death that which is fading away and the ministry of condemnation with the possible exception of the commandment about the sabbath it is difficult to see why paul would refer to the commands in ex two zero one one seven as being temporary fading away type commandments this is less of a problem if the stone tablets should happen to have included all of the commandments from ex two zero through ex three one arguments against this idea the main argument against this idea aside from the fact that it contradicts a long standing tradition is that in dt five two two moses says after quoting the commands in ex two zero one one seven these words the lord spoke and he added no more and he wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me this appears to identify the words just quoted as being the only contents of the two stone tablets that was my first impression anyway however after some thought i noted that a great deal hinges on how you understand the phrase these words if moses meant these words which i have just related to you were spoken by god etc then that would mean that only the traditional ten commandments were on the stone tablets if however moses was making a parenthetical comment these words which i am now telling you were spoken by god etc then that s quite different i did note that in the dt five account moses tells of being given the stone tablets before telling of the people asking moses to represent them before god whereas in the exodus account the people asked this of moses between the first and second discourses several days before god gave moses the stone tablets this reinforces the idea that moses remarks in dt five two two ff were intended as a parenthetical remark rather than a strictly chronological account of when god wrote what and at what point he stopped adding to what was on the tablets summary all things considered i find it somewhat more likely that the nine commands in ex two zero are really only the first of what moses regarded as the ten discourses of god i don t know if anybody has ever espoused this idea before it s brand new to me so while i lean towards accepting it i would be very interested in hearing any comments and criticisms anyone may care to offer mark
 from wagner grace math uh edu david wagner subject re homosexual issues in christianity organization uh dept of math lines eight four michael michael siemon writes michael the kind of interpretation i see as incredibly perverse is michael that applied to the story of sodom as if it were a blanket michael equation of homosexual behavior and rape since christians michael citing the bible in such a context should be presumed to have michael at least read the story it amounts to slander a charge michael that homosexuality rape to use that against us and michael it is just michael as wrong though slightly less incendiary so it s a michael secondary argument from the phobic contingent to equate michael homosexuality with such behavior as to equate it with the michael rape of god s messengers let s review the sodom and gomorrah story briefly it states clearly that the visitors were angels but all the men from every part of the city of sodom both young and old surrounded the house they called to lot where are the men who came to you tonight bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them for the rest of the story the angels are referred to by the men of sodom and by lot as men furthermore we know from gen one eight two zero two one that the lord had already found sodom guilty of grievous sin before the angels visited the city it is clear that the grievous sin of sodom and gomorrah involved homosexual sex it appears that the men had become so inflamed in their lust that they had group orgies in the public square which simply indicates the extremity of their depravity it does not show that lesser degrees of homosexuality are not sinful as michael would have us believe ultimately our understanding of god s will for sexuality comes from the creation story not solely on the story of sodom and gomorrah he created us male and female and instituted marriage as a relationship between one male and one female therefore a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife and they will become one flesh this marriage relationship is the only sexual relationship which god blesses and sanctions he regulates and protects the marriage of man and woman and even uses it as a picture of the relationship between himself and his church but we find not one word of blessing or regulation for a sexual relationship between two men or between two women everything else that we find in the bible about sexuality derives from or expresses god s will in instituting and blessing marriage thus the levitical code which was given only to the jews forbade incest homosexuality bestiality the ten commandments forbade adultery and the coveting of our neighbor s wife other commandments forbade rape the men of sodom and gomorrah were regarded as sexually immoral and perverse jude seven because they abandoned and or polluted the marriage relationship thus also paul regarded homosexuality as unnatural romans one two six two seven not because this was simply paul s opinion but because it was contrary to god s purpose in creating us male and female michael christians no doubt very sincere ones keep showing up here michael and in every corner of usenet and the world and all they michael ever do is spout these same old verses which they obviously michael have never thought about maybe never even read in total michael ignorance of the issues raised slandering us with the vilest michael charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can michael manage to conjure up tossing out red herrings with they michael suppose great emotional force to cause readers to dismiss michael our witness without even taking the trouble to find out what michael it is really have you no better response to slander than more slander david h wagner the day is surely drawing near a confessional lutheran when god s son the annointed shall with great majesty appear as judge of all appointed all mirth and laughter then shall cease when flames on flames will still increase as scripture truly teacheth es ist gewisslich an der zeit v one bartholomaeus ringwaldt one five eight six

 from torsina enuxhb eas asu edu who subject islam satanic organization arizona state university lines eight zero dear fellow christians i had a dinner last night with a bible study group which i am in we had a discussion about the difference between christianity and islam and i was shocked to hear that our bible study teacher said that mohammad was indeed a prophet but of satan i said what i did not believe that because i have some moslem friends who are so kind and nice even sometimes i feel i wish i could be like them in my point of view they don t sin as much as i do how come if they were under satan they could have such personalities to tell you the truth i don t know much about islam but i know that they believe in god they believe in the day of judgement now i m asking you what your opinions about islam and its teaching important i do not want to discuss whether they are saved or not i do not want to discuss about politic related to islam p s i post this in bit listserv christia soc religion christian and bit listserv catholic in christ our lord smile jesus loves you tabut torsina torsina enuxhb eas asu edu let me start by saying that this is not the right newsgroup for a discussion of islam since there s a group for that but i suspect the point your teacher was making was not specifically about islam indeed it s going to be impossible to see what he was getting at within your groundrules since the question of whether non christians are saved is at the heart of it the classic christian view which i think most people believed until the last century or so was that christianity and of course judaism was the only religion founded by god and that all other religions worshipped false gods and came from satan this is more or less a corollary of another traditional view that no one but christians and possibly jews will be saved this need not mean that there s no truth in any other religion nor that all of their members are intentionally satanic after all in order to be an effective snare satanic alternatives would have to be attractive thus they might contain all kinds of truth wisdom and spiritual insights they would be missing only one thing knowledge of salvation through christ if this is the background of your teacher s remarks and i suspect it is that means that a discussion of islam is not necessarily relevant the point is not that there s anything intrinsically wrong with it it may teach a fine code of behavior and its practitioners may all be wonderful people but if salvation requires being a follower of christ it could still be a satanic invention this is a reasonable deduction from the classic protestant position christianity says that salvation isn t a matter of being kind and nice those are good things and we should encourage them but no one is able to do them enough to be saved salvation requires christ please forgive me for doing this in protestant terms there s a catholic equivalent to this that has similar implications but in different terms a religion may be quite attractive in all visible ways but if it doesn t have christ it s like a diet that consists of food that looks wonderful tastes great but is missing some essential food element so that you end up dying let me be clear that i am not specifically advocating this position what i m trying to do is as usual to clarify issues indeed it is now relatively uncommon for christians to believe that all other religions are satanic most christians regard such beliefs as an unfortunate vestige of the past this is part of a general move within christianity in the last century or so to a non judgemental god christians now find it hard to believe that god would allow anybody other than a really rotten person to end up in hell and they find it hard to envision that real malignant spiritual forces are at work in the world doing things like creating superficially attractive alternatives to christianity whether there is actually a sound basis for the shift is a decision that people need to make for themselves clh
 from af six six four yfn ysu edu frank decenso jr subject re christianity in crisis organization youngstown state youngstown free net lines three seven one from bit listserv christia zane writes from facn three four b saupm zero zero bitnet zane of dhahan newsgroups bit listserv christia subject christianity in crisis date wed may one two one four four three one nine one nine nine three frank first of all thanks for all of the great scripture verses it was a pleasure to read them my reply you are welcome zane zane i am sure nothing that i will say will change your mind about it but i would like to ask you if the book in question really does anything for you i mean were you all caught up in the word faith thing but now that you have read the book you ve been rescued from all of the error and pain that will result in your christian life my reply one when i first became a christian i entered into the word faith movement it was easy i wasn t grounded in the word of god and sound doctrine when i visited christian book stores the cheapest books i could find to buy were the five zero and one zero zero books by hagin and others consequently i began receiving hagin s monthly magazine and they still send it to me and also copeland s also still sent to me it wasn t until i read a booklet by jimmy swaggart called hyper faith the new gnosticism that i began to realize the teachings i were partaking of were error i started reading the bible more and studying more sure enough jimmy was right in many points as part of my experience i am alerting christians particularly new christians that these teachings are heretical and they need to do as the bereans did in acts one seven one one check these teachings out with scripture two my brother in law was involved in a word faith cult in my area it s leader is real good friends with benny hinn rather then going into much detail about this suffice it to say he was deceived mistreated and has now fallen into atheism i m still praying for him phil one six three the assistant pastor at the church i teach adult sunday school in has been a follower of copeland for one five years he has thousands of tapes by the faith teachers in the class recently i quoted several of the teachers heretical statements to his surprise since then i ve been able to talk to him at length about these issues four the leader of the women s group at my church is a benny hinn fan recently i found that she has been lending good morning holy spirit to women in the church that prompted my quotes in sunday school as well as my lending cic to people in the church i m well aware of the abuses and heresies perpetrated in this movement and have an urgency in my heart and life to warn people about the heresies what heresies a jesus became sin took on the very nature of the devil and became one with him b jesus death on the cross wasn t enough to atone c jesus was dragged to hell after his death was beat and abused by satan and demons thus finishing our atonement satan was ruling over him there d jesus was born again in hell e jesus died spiritually lost his divinity and reassumed it after the resurrection f we are gods these are heresies documentation will be provided re these teachings upon request zane or what does it do for you is it preventing you from going out and joining up with the word faith movement which you d been contemplating joining for so long but now that you ve read the book you ve been saved from all of that my reply it wasn t christianity in crisis that helped me it was a booklet by swaggart that i mentioned above but cic is much much better tremendous documentation and insights zane i don t have a nice scriptural answer for why i believe it is at best un profitable for christians to engage in this type of activity heresy hunting my reply why do you call it heresy hunting hunting implies it isn t readily accessible or available this movement is the fastest growing movement in christendom hagin has sold over four zero million books and booklets hinn has sold more books in the last couple of years than swindoll and dobson combined fred price has the largest church in terms of seating capacity in the usa doesn t sound like much hunting is needed it is scriptural to expose doctrinal error i gave some verses to you before more can be given most of the epistles were written due to error doctrinal practical in the churches the early church had numerous councils to expose error and heresy it s not a new thing remember luther zane i would like to point out though that historically those who hunt heretics often end up causing a bigger mess than the heretics but this is my un documented opinion my reply one if you can provide documentation it would be appreciated two read ephesians four one one one six esp vss one three and one four and tell me what causes disunity and immaturity in the body eph four one three one four till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god to a perfect man to the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ that we should no longer be children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the trickery of men in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting disunity contrary to popular opinion isn t caused by exposing error it s caused by error zane there are many who probably give no place for seeing the scriptures as documenting a spiritual development or growth in its writers but i would suggest that the fiery paul of the letter to the galatians mellows and matures into the one who loses all for the sake of love in the end my reply most scholars believe paul wrote two timothy last let s examine his admonitions to tim to ascertain how mellow he had become two ti one one three one five hold fast the pattern of sound words which you have heard from me in faith and love which are in christ jesus that good thing which was committed to you keep by the holy spirit who dwells in us this you know that all those in asia have turned away from me among whom are phygellus and hermogenes two ti two one five one eight be diligent to present yourself approved to god a worker who does not need to be ashamed rightly dividing the word of truth but shun profane and idle babblings for they will increase to more ungodliness and their message will spread like cancer hymenaeus and philetus are of this sort who have strayed concerning the truth saying that the resurrection is already past and they overthrow the faith of some two ti two two four two six and a servant of the lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all able to teach patient in humility correcting those who are in opposition if god perhaps will grant them repentance so that they may know the truth and that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil having been taken captive by him to do his will two ti three six nine for of this sort are those who creep into households and make captives of gullible women loaded down with sins led away by various lusts always learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth now as jannes and jambres resisted moses so do these also resist the truth men of corrupt minds disapproved concerning the faith but they will progress no further for their folly will be manifest to all as theirs also was two ti three one two one seven yes and all who desire to live godly in christ jesus will suffer persecution but evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse deceiving and being deceived but you must continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of knowing from whom you have learned them and that from childhood you have known the holy scriptures which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in christ jesus all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of god may be complete thoroughly equipped for every good work two ti four two five preach the word be ready in season and out of season convince rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and teaching for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine but according to their own desires because they have itching ears they will heap up for themselves teachers and they will turn their ears away from the truth and be turned aside to fables but you be watchful in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist fulfill your ministry two ti four one four one five alexander the coppersmith did me much harm may the lord repay him according to his works you also must beware of him for he has greatly resisted our words zane the picture i have of paul is not of one who goes out of his way to destroy the ministry of wolves but of one who teaches the sheep with many tears the necessity of absolutely not allowing themselves to be transformed into wolves to protect themselves my reply act two zero two six three one therefore i testify to you this day that i am innocent of the blood of all men for i have not shunned to declare to you the whole counsel of god therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock among which the holy spirit has made you overseers to shepherd the church of god which he purchased with his own blood for i know this that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you not sparing the flock also from among yourselves men will rise up speaking perverse things to draw away the disciples after themselves therefore watch and remember that for three years i did not cease to warn everyone night and day with tears zane for all the warning paul does it is of note that he never once drops a name of a wolf but i will admit he cries in his beard at the end over those who have abandoned him everyone in asia wasn t it my reply paul mentioned names one ti one one eight two zero this charge i commit to you son timothy according to the prophecies previously made concerning you that by them you may wage the good warfare having faith and a good conscience which some having rejected concerning the faith have suffered shipwreck of whom are hymenaeus and alexander whom i delivered to satan that they may learn not to blaspheme two ti one one five this you know that all those in asia have turned away from me among whom are phygellus and hermogenes two ti two one six one eight but shun profane and idle babblings for they will increase to more ungodliness and their message will spread like cancer hymenaeus and philetus are of this sort who have strayed concerning the truth saying that the resurrection is already past and they overthrow the faith of some two ti four one zero for demas has forsaken me having loved this present world and has departed for thessalonica crescens for galatia titus for dalmatia two ti four one four one five alexander the coppersmith did me much harm may the lord repay him according to his works you also must beware of him for he has greatly resisted our words so did john three jo one nine one zero i wrote to the church but diotrephes who loves to have the preeminence among them does not receive us therefore if i come i will call to mind his deeds which he does prating against us with malicious words and not content with that he himself does not receive the brethren and forbids those who wish to putting them out of the church jesus also singled out teachings and doctrines rev two one four one six but i have a few things against you because you have there those who hold the doctrine of balaam who taught balak to put a stumbling block before the children of israel to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit sexual immorality thus you also have those who hold the doctrine of the nicolaitans which thing i hate repent or else i will come to you quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth rev two two zero two three nevertheless i have a few things against you because you allow that woman jezebel who calls herself a prophetess to teach and seduce my servants to commit sexual immorality and eat things sacrificed to idols and i gave her time to repent of her sexual immorality and she did not repent indeed i will cast her into a sickbed and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation unless they repent of their deeds i will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that i am he who searches the minds and hearts and i will give to each one of you according to your works zane i question too the purposes of those who write books and build ministries on the faults deliberate or otherwise of others maybe if they would wander around in the desert eating locust and honey or barely cakes with no worldly goods at stake money to be made or no reputations to maintain i would question their motives conscious or otherwise less my reply i won t comment on this because it deals with the intangible motives of others but even if they had bad motives remember what paul said phi one one five one eight some indeed preach christ even from envy and strife and some also from good will the former preach christ from selfish ambition not sincerely supposing to add affliction to my chains but the latter out of love knowing that i am appointed for the defense of the gospel what then only that in every way whether in pretense or in truth christ is preached and in this i rejoice yes and will rejoice zane if we want to be true to the admonitions of scripture many of which you list about protecting ourselves and the flock from wolves and winds of doctrines i suggest we start by allowing the wolf program in our own noetic pasture to be nailed to the cross my reply please explain zane secondly i suggest any heresy hunting be restricted to our own fellowships which in the strict scriptural sense is the local city church my reply if heresy was not being propagated over the mass media then it may not be needed to go mass media with the exposure unfortunately heresy is being taught not just in copeland s church or hagin s or hinn s or price s but all over the radio in print etc no pastor or church leader knows what materials the sheep are feeding on outside the church it s imperative that leadership be made aware of this and cic does just that also let s examine a passage of scripture eph four one one and he himself gave some to be apostles some prophets some evangelists and some pastors and teachers eph four one two for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry for the edifying of the body of christ these ministry gifts that the lord installs in the church are not just for one individual church but for the body of christ paul was an apostle he traveled all over distilling his message he was also a teacher one co four one seven for this reason i have sent timothy to you who is my beloved and faithful son in the lord who will remind you of my ways in christ as i teach everywhere in every church one co seven one seven but as god has distributed to each one as the lord has called each one so let him walk and so i ordain in all the churches also one co one two two eight and god has appointed these in the church first apostles second prophets third teachers after that miracles then gifts of healings helps administrations varieties of tongues eph four one three till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god to a perfect man to the measure of the stature of the fullness of christ notice that the five fold ministries are going to be around till the church is in unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the son of god to a perfect man this i believe will not occur fully until the lord jesus returns see one cor one three nine one two but god wants the body to continue on maturing what hinders maturity and unity of the body eph four one four that we should no longer be children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the trickery of men in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting it s clear that false doctrine integrated into the church by the trickery of men causes one disunity the thing we are striving for and two spiritual immaturity the church continues in spiritual childhood when christians are tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine the five fold ministry of which there does not appear to be clear scriptural denominational boundaries pastors appear responsible for their individual flock is to deal with these doctrines when necessary in their struggle to equip the body all believers are called to do this to a degree jud one three four beloved while i was very diligent to write to you concerning our common salvation i found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints for certain men have crept in unnoticed who long ago were marked out for this condemnation ungodly men who turn the grace of our god into lewdness and deny the only lord god and our lord jesus christ zane if you ll notice in scripture the heresy hunters that went from church to church and area to area were the bad guys and they went after the good guy namely paul who they considered to be the arch heretic my reply they were themselves heretics trying to discredit paul who was preaching contrary to what they taught zane let s face it the wolves are here for a reason and we are here for the reason and let s hope the wolves become sheep and the sheep lambs my reply yes two ti two two four two six and a servant of the lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all able to teach patient in humility correcting those who are in opposition if god perhaps will grant them repentance so that they may know the truth and that they may come to their senses and escape the snare of the devil having been taken captive by him to do his will amen frank if one wished to contend with him he could not answer him one time out of a thousand job nine three

 from dan ingres com a rose arose subject re the arrogance of christians organization representing my own views and not that of my company here lines one two two news cbnewsk att com writes arrogance is arrogance it is not the result of religion it is the result of people knowing or firmly believing in an idea and one s desire to show others of one s rightness i assume that god decided to be judge for our sake as much as his own if we allow him who is kind and merciful be the judge we ll probably be better off than if others judged us or we judged ourselves i m not sure i agree with this one zero zero i agree that arrogance is not the result of religion and that god is a far better judge than we are i also agree if you mean to say that arrogance shows up in the form of trying to prove one s superior knowledge rightness or holiness over another person s beliefs i need to be careful to understand what you mean here so that i do not fall into the mistake of misrepresenting your views if i fall down in this area i hope you will forgive me arrogance is not the result of believing one is right or of believing that one s god is greater than the god s of others or of believing that one s religion is better than other religions these are all naturally self implied beliefs it is self contradictory to say that i believe my current beliefs to be wrong were i to find myself in error my beliefs would naturally change and follow what i believe to be right therefore i must always consider my beliefs correct that s not arrogance that s unavoidable behavior it is nonsense to say that i believe another person s god to be greater than my god were his or her god greater wouldn t i be obligated to change so that their god would become my god we are naturally obligated to worship that god which we deem to be the greatest why should we feel obligated to worship a second best god for the sake of feeling humble arrogance is not necessarily thinking onesself to be better looking or more intelligent or stronger or having more resources than another person no doubt many will have to chew on this one awhile were passive observation of one s superior points arrogance then god would be most arrogant of all humility does not rest in slandering or belittling god s work of creation in our lives people often go around trying to be humble saying to one another i m not very smart i m poor i m not good looking i m just a worm in the ground i m such a weak person and although i don t want to sin i really cannot help it were this person truely humble he would take a different approach god thank you for making me the way you did i know that you never do anything second best yet with all that you have given me i have been so unthankful you ve given me power to resist the devil i have not used it but have indulged myself in doing exactly what you have said not to do i have slandered your creation in my life and have credited myself with humility for doing so lord with all you ve given me i have been completely unfaithful and i do not deserve your forgiveness and yet your love for me is so boundless that you would give yourself to die for me to save me as terribly evil as i am i deserve to go straight to hell yet it pleases you somehow to rescue me from this terrible life i ve led lord please forgive me and help me stay on the right track so that i can bring glory to your name instead of insult lord i m so sorry for my wrongs please help me to change i think people take exceptional offense to religious arrogance because they don t want to be wrong if i find someone arrogant i typically don t have anything to do with them for me i ve often found it hard to tell the difference often times the most humble christian has come across to me as arrogant while the most proud worm in the ground false humility type person has been found to be most comfortable company when i m wrong and arrogant about my wrongness i certainly don t feel like being confronted by my wrongness were someone to confront me verbally with my wrongness i d be likely to snap at them and examine them head to toe for all their faults and charge them with hypocricy for what they said to me at the root my desire would be to make them shut up so that i can go about living my life arrogantly as i wish however were someone to confront me silently by their example earn my respect and perhaps mention it to me in humility in private i d feel broken down and challenged to seek god for help in changing from the error of my ways the hard part is getting to the point to where i can be humble before anyone regardless of their humility or pride regardless of their hypocricy or sincerity regardless of whether onlookers will frown down upon me or not it isn t easy to take this pain in love with thankfulness for the opportunity to improve in one s ability to serve god it s easier to cast aside any hope of reaching true humility and merely hide behind slandering god s creation in our lives instead but we should examine ourselves i hope i typed this back in right and why we react to certain situations with such emotions for instance many of us feel justified to be insulted by an arrogant person as if we needed a reason to feel insulted but after being insulted over and over again by the words of others you d think we d either toughen up or decide not to be insulted or ignore the insult just because you can justify feelings of anger or insult or outrage that doesn t make that reaction the appropriate one it is in this light of self examination that we can change our emotional reactions sometimes it helps when we can understand and feel the difference between what is a true statement of our character and what is a false and slanderous statement of our character the devil is the accuser of the bretheren he would love us to feel hopelessly guilty where we are innocent and feel arrogant and self righteous where we are indeed wrong the devil s aim is to get us into as much misery as he can just think of the devil as a cruel and merci less criminal who torments a parent by burning his or her children with hot irons the way the devil gets under the father s skin is by hurting those that the father loves so much i deplore the horrible crime of child murder we want prevention not merely punishment we must reach the root of the evil it is practiced by those whose inmost souls revolt from the dreadful deed no mater what the motive love of ease or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent the woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed but oh thrice guilty is he who drove her to the desperation which impelled her to the crime susan b anthony the revolution july eight one eight six nine

 from hudson athena cs uga edu paul hudson jr subject re faq essay on homosexuality organization university of georgia athens lines two zero one in article hedrick geneva rutgers edu writes this came from here s his response kinsey see below is the source of the figure one zero percent there was an article in usa today a few months ago showing the results of a study that actually only about one were homosexual i saw another figure that listed two as the figure of course even if it were nine nine that would have little bearing on whether or not it is a sinful behavior how many people have commited other acts of fornication how many people have lied or sinned in other ways but in all fairness the shameless nature of their acts is a reflection of the general spiritual state of the people and not a specific feature of homosexuality why isn t it a specific feature of homosexuality paul describes men with men working that which is unseemly to describe the acts sure there spirtual nature was depraved also and like the other sins the idolatry the other sexual immoraity and the other sins sprang from their depraved spiritual state which was a result of man s not glorifying god as god and being thankful still their acts were shameless homosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases on the other hand none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the subject rom one is really about idolatry it refers to homosexuality in passing is everything sinful specifically elaborated on in the new testament scripture does not condemn being a drug dealer being ruled by the spirit rather than the letter not only frees from legalism it also protects us from sins that are against the spirit the word is a two edged sword that cuts both ways i think we must be careful before we totally throw out leviticus if the law is reflection of god s character and true holy nature then those who say that god endorses homosexuality run into a problem if homosexuality were natural whatever that means wholesome endorsed by god and those who oppose sexual behavior are narrow minded biggots as some would have us believe why is there a condemnation of it in leviticus this condemnation is in the midst of all the other sex sin condemnations and there is nothing in the text to say that this law was limited to temple prostitution and no good reason to believe that this was the case furthermore male homosexual sex was a death penalty crime is every sin elaborated on in the new testament take a look at i corinthians five paul said that one of the corinthians had broken a law not even heard of among the gentiles that one should have his father s wife there is a prohibition against having your father s wife in leviticus no other new testament verse clearly condemns it besides this one notice that paul did not say that the sin was in commiting adultery etc he spoke against having one s father s wife notice also that this sexual condemnation in leviticus is not mentioned in the specific context of paganism either and there was no pagan coustom mentioned in i corinthians either as a matter of fact taking one s father s wife wasn t even done among the gentiles it was just a plain blantant sin whether worshipping idols was involved or not one commonly made claim is that paul had simply never faced the kinds of questions we are trying to deal with he encountered homosexuality only in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was wrong he had never faced the experience of christians who try to act straight and fail and he had never faced christians who are trying to define a christian homosexuality which fits with general christian ideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the relationship between god and man it is unfair to take paul s judgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make judgements on these questions one of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argument is because paul probably did face this and other problems sin can be tough to over come especially without supernatural power is homosexual sin any more difficult to overcome that heterosexual sin like lusting after a married woman or sleeping around with people of the opposite sex i doubt it and even if it is that is no excuse god is greater than all of it another reason we reject it is because it ignores the supernatural power of god to intervene in this kind of situation how many people have been set free from sin by the power of god sure there may be any groups that have tried to change homosexuals and failed that is a reflection on the people involved in the program and not god s willingness and ability to change a sinner any program that uses formulas may fail what people need is the power of god to change them whether they are involved in homosexual sin or any other sin i claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual christians is not entirely a theological issue but also a pastoral one paul s tendency as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating holidays is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues to look very carefully at the good of the people involved and to avoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging for example while paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat meat he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about which they had personal qualms i don t see how you come to that conclusion paul s dealings with pastorial issues encouraged people to give up their liberties in order to spare others not to allow people to continue in sin because it was just too difficult take the example of eating meat offered to idols paul felt that there was nothing wrong in an abstract sense with eating the meat yet he advised believers to sacrifice their liberty to eat meat in order to spare others but paul never allowed people to sin because living holy was just to tough paul wrote to make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts thereof romans one three one four then he goes in to a discourse on how we should sacrifice our own liberty in order to spare the consciences of others suppose it were not a sin for people to practice homosexual acts since others consider it to be a sin then using paul s approach on pastorial issues those who would otherwise be homosexuals should sacrifice their liberty and be celbate or monogamously married to a member of the opposite sex paul never offers a lesser sin homosexual marriage to prevent people from engaging in what may be considered a more damaging sin for another example paul obviously would have preferred to see people at least in some circumstances remain unmarried yet if they were unable to do so he certainly would rather see them married than in a state where they might be tempted to fornication yet marriage itself is not a sin marriage is holy in all and something that god ordains and paul recognizes this note that in the creation story work enters human life as a result of sin this doesn t mean that christians can stop working when we are saved actually adam was put in the garden to tend to it before he fell after he fell he would have to toil over the ground the dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often fails and when it does you end up with damage ranging from psychological damage to suicide as well as broken marriages when attempts at living as a heterosexual fail that is why we are dependent totally on god what a vunerable and glorious position to be it we all must be transformed by the renewing of our minds and that is the only way homosexuals can walk in freedom just like anyone else but i can well imagine paul preferring to see people in long term committed christian relationships than promiscuity as with work which genesis suggests wasn t part of god s original ideal either i think such relationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing god s love with each other i m sure you can see how people with the opposing view see this conclusion it s like saying how should i kill myself with gun or aresenic what about the person who just is overcome with a desire to sleep with goats would it be better for him to sleep with one goat or all of them what about the person who wants to sleep with his aunts would it be better for him to sleep with one aunt or all of them in all these cases the more people or animals one sleeps with the higher the chance that they will get a disease but this only deals with physical aspects of the question whichever sin is commited it all leads to spiritual death cent actions are the same when christian homosexuals say that their relationships are different than the greek homosexuality that paul would have been familiar with this is exactly the same kind of argument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors the issue that is most often addressed in scripture seems to be the actual act second isn t it historical snobbery to say that only homosexuals of this century are capable of having loving relationships there are ancient writings glorifying homosexual love btw i am one who believes in refraining from making oathes also where do you get that tax collectors are sinners that s certainly not explicit jesus didn t tell zachias to quit his job link hudson i m reluctant to comment in this in detail our basic concepts of the intention of jesus and paul are greatly different as i indicated in the article whatever the ambiguities of various words and i still think they are significant it does seem clear that paul considered the homosexuality he saw around him wrong what you do with this fact depends upon your basic approach to the bible i m afraid that communication between legalist and anti legalist christians is even harder than between protestants and catholics in the one six th cent since you disagree with my starting point obviously you re going to disagree with all of the intermediate discussion and conclusions sometimes discussion is still useful i ve seen some very interesting work on paul done by jews obviously they don t agree with him but they sometimes have helpful insight into what he meant but i don t see much sign for hope here in talk religion misc there s an axiom that by the time hitler s name is invoked all hope for sensible discussion is gone on this subject when sleeping with goats is invoked i don t think there s enough basis for understanding to be worth pursuing clh

prism gatech edu randal lee nicholas mandock writes in article muirm argon gas organpipe uug arizona edu maxwell c muir writes in all candor i would be happy to be proven wrong about believing in atheism problem is i will have to be proven wrong in mentioning some nonsense about psychology and atheism bob muir asks the following question no smiley on the part about atheism i see do you realize that your statement says that i was mentioning nonsense about atheism this is hard for me to defend against if this is the claim you are making as you have only included the last two sentences of my post and mentioned the first please address the substance of my post rather than rejecting it out of hand but because of the sometimes ambiguous nature of english i may be misinterpreting your wording here please clarify did you or did you not mean to call my statements about atheism nonsense if so care to back up that claim do i sound broken to you i answer in the affirmative ok then start up the amatuer psycology again how am i broken is it politically correct for christians to be the only besieged group permitted the luxury of arrogance yawn excuse me i don t recall any portion of my post in which i called christians arrogant quote me if i did i do remember calling christianity silly and then following that up with information that i was nine years old when i thought that i also said that i find faith to be intellectually dishonest and i would like to see some sort of proof of your god s existence i define faith as belief in the absense of any proof btw also i subscribe to a a as i mentioned and we see fundies of all types there so in answer to your question no finally i d hardly call christianity beseiged in this country i seldom see christians ridiculed for merely practising their religion or wearing crosses or having christian bumper stickers i don t know for sure of course i only say i haven t seen it happening what i have seen happening is my homosexual and or friends being beat up or preached at by people who claim to be christ s followers i know that this sort of thing isn t practiced by the majority of christians but it is a very vocal minority who are doing it and i don t see comperable victimization of christians now i have a question for bob why in the world would any self respecting atheist want to subscribe to a christian news group the implication being that i am not self respecting of course i m not a student of psychology btw but i am a student of creative writing and linguistics so literary analysis is my forte also if the implications i see are improper please let me know i m here because i m not sequestered in my own little atheist cubbyhole as you seem to think atheists should be did it occur to you that i don t think i know everything and that maybe someone will say something that will change my life have you read my other posts here or did you see atheist and decide it was time to poke at someone who doesn t deserve your respect aw geez i m sorry i probably am getting my back up a little too high here it s just that the nonsense thing really annoys me i figure you should see my first reactions though since they are my true reactions to your question now the smoothed feather version i seek all sorts of knowledge that s why i came to my university yes i am looking at your religion well sorta i have no idea what kind of christian you are from the outside and hopefully with an objective view i ve been trying to ask reasoned questions here because i genuinely don t know the answers to them but when i saw the question directed at atheists i figured i would answer after all you can speculate about atheist motives here all you want hence the amatuer psychology crack but without an atheist you can t be sure of even one atheist s motive i m hoping people really want to know and i was trying to show that i actually checked out several religions and i actually read all the pamphlets people have to offer and i actually think about these things instead i m still faced with the implication that atheism is some kind of aberration and that only broken people are atheist try it from the flip side i posit that atheism is the natural state and only broken people are theists i offer as proof that so many people witness from horrible lives which picked up as soon as they discovered their religion that religion is regional if people didn t follow the religion of their areas there would be a more homogenous mix so many terrorists claim theistic motives and that theists tend to be so pushy and angry when challenged on alt atheism why are religions so successful because there is so much suffering in the world which breaks people it s an uncomfortable situation whichever way you look at it which is another reason i m here to try to see the flip side of my thinking and also as a watchdog for logical fallacies i have a difficult enough time keeping up with it and i think i know something about the subject the implication here being that atheists can t possibly know anything about christianity probably jumping at shadows again but i think my reaction is somewhat justified after all the first post suggested that atheists are broken hostile people this post confirms that someone else believes it bob reminds me of my roommate in order to disbelieve atheism he says he will need to be proven wrong about it well he got me there i am a strong atheist because i feel that lack of evidence especially about something like an omnipotent being implies lack of existence however i haven t met the strong atheist yet who said that nothing could ever persuade him call me a seeker if you like i don t weak atheism is being ignore here though some atheists simply say i don t believe in any god rather than my position i believe that no god s exist for the weak atheist the is no atheism to disbelieve because they don t actively believe in atheism if you think this is confusing try figuring out the difference between protestants and methodists from an atheist point of view this is another fallacy many theists seem to have that everyone believes in something followed up by everyone has faith in something guess what my atheism ends the moment i m shown a proof of some god s existence is that really too much to ask well i don t even waste my time trying well i guess you won t succeed in converting him or me why the supposition that you will fail to convince him amatuer psycology on is it because you yourself are unconvinced i tell him that he ll just have to take my word for it and i told you that i find faith to be intellectually dishonest note that i can only speak for myself if you find faith to be honest show me how i have been unable to reconcile it so far maybe that s how i m broken i tell you that i have invisible fairies living in my garden and that you should just take my word for it if you accept that you are of a fundamentally different mind than i and i really would like to know how you think all i ask for is proof of the assertion god exists logical or physical proofs only please then we ll discuss the nature of god in response he tells me he will say an atheist s prayer for me prayer uh oh we ll have to revoke his atheist club card and beanie good luck bob and best regards good luck to you as well and again i apologize if the inferences i made

 from wagner grace math uh edu david wagner subject re baptism requires faith organization uh dept of math lines one three two aaron aaron bryce cardenas writes aaron colossians two one one one two in him you were also circumcised in the aaron putting off of the sinful nature not with a circumcision done aaron by christ having been buried with him in baptism and raised aaron with him through your faith in the power of god who raised him aaron from the dead aaron in baptism we are raised to a new life in christ romans six four aaron through a personal faith in the power of god our parent s aaron faith cannot do this do infants have faith let s look at aaron what the bible has to say about it yes let do try and if anyone causes one of these little ones who believes in me to sin it would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone tied around his neck mark nine four two let the little children come to me and do not hinder them for the kingdom of god belongs to such as these i tell you the truth anyone who will not receive the kingdom of god like a little child will never enter it the colossians passage does not make faith a requirement for baptism it merely says that in baptism we are born again regenerated and resurrected through faith in the case of an infant i would say that baptism works faith in the heart of the infant through the power of the word the colossians passage does make baptism a spiritual circumcision circumcision was the means by which a male infant was made a part of god s covenant with israel it was commanded to be performed on the eighth day the early church understood this and even debated whether baptism had to be performed on the eighth day or if it could in fact be done earlier aaron romans one zero one six one seven but not all the israelites accepted the good aaron news for isaiah says lord who has believed our message aaron consequently faith comes from hearing the message and the aaron message is heard through the word of christ aaron so then we receive god s gift of faith to us as we hear the aaron message of the gospel and the gospel is surely preached at any infant s or adult s baptism indeed in a very real sense the sacraments are the gospel made tangible aaron faith is a possible response to hearing aaron god s word preached kids are not yet spiritually aaron intellectually or emotionally mature enough to respond to aaron god s word how do you know they are not yet mature enough to have faith do you know this on the basis of god s word or from your own reason faith is also described as a gift from god ephesians two eight nine he gives faith to infants just as he gives it to adults through the power of the gospel romans one six aaron if you read all of ezekiel one eight you will see that god doesn t aaron hold us guilty for anyone else s sins so we can have no aaron original guilt from adam here you show that you just don t understand original sin you are arguing against a straw man maybe you ve been talking to catholics too much i don t know but original sin does not consist of god s imputation of adam s guilt to us it consists of our inheritance of adam s sinful nature it is actual sin see for example the augsburg confession article ii and the apology of the augsburg confession article ii and for extra credit john knox s the scots confession article iii aaron now then that we have a little more background as to why aaron original sin is not biblical let s look at some of the aaron scriptures used to support it aaron romans five one two therefore just as sin entered the world through aaron one man and death through sin and in this way death came to aaron all men because all sinned ask yourself this question do infants ever die then ask yourself if infant baptism is not valid then where was the christian church during all the centuries when almost all of the baptisms were performed on infants were luther melancthon calvin zwingli hus knox andrae and chemnitz christians aaron psalm five one five surely i was sinful at birth sinful from the time aaron my mother conceived me aaron this whole psalm is a wonderful example of how we should humble aaron ourselves before god in repentance for sinning david himself aaron was a man after god s own heart and wrote the psalm after aaron committing adultry with bathsheba and murdering her husband aaron all that david is saying here is that he can t remember a time aaron when he wasn t sinful he is humbling himself before god by aaron confessing his sinfulness his saying that he was sinful at aaron birth is a hyperbole the bible being inspired by god isn t aaron limited to a literal interpetation but also uses figures of aaron speech as did jesus john one six two five for another example of aaron hyperbole see luke one four two six who are you to say what is literal and what is not is a literal interpretation manifestly absurd in psalm five one by reason of direct contradiction with a clear passage from the word of god you might also compare genesis eight two one the lord smelled the pleasing aroma and said in his heart never again will i curse the ground because of man even though every inclination of his heart is evil from childhood aaron we see aaron that he did grow and become wiser in luke two four zero and two five two the aaron implication is that jesus did wrong things as a child before he aaron knew to choose right over wrong you are a long way from proving this rather monstrous assertion all you can say is that jesus grew in wisdom and in stature a conclusion that he did wrong as a child is based on an extrapolation of reason not on a direct revelation in scripture david h wagner but mad reason rushes forth and a confessional lutheran because baptism is not dazzling like the works which we do regards it as worthless martin luther large catechism fourth part baptism
 from kolassa genesee bst rochester edu john kolassa subject re definition of christianity organization university of rochester biostatistics lines two nine in article clh writes often we get into discussions about who is christian unfortunately there are a number of possible definitions starting from the broadest commonly used definitions are three the next level is an attempt to give a broad doctrinal definition which includes all of the major strands of christianity but excludes groups that are felt to be outside historic christianity this is of course a slippery enterprise since catholics could argue that protestants are outside historic christianity etc but i think the most commonly accepted definition would be based on something like the nicene creed and the formula of chalcedon are you sure you want to include chalcedon here i presume that you mean the description of jesus as fully human and fully devine almost everyone would consider the majority of copts and armenians and the jacobites as christians yet for one five centuries it has been maintained that they disagree with the formula of chalcedon those that wouldn t consider them christians are most likely to object that these communities don t require a personal commitment to jesus which is only tangentially related to the formula of chalcedon thanks john kolassa kolassa bio one bst rochester edu as i understand the recent discussion here the copts for all practical purposes accept chalcedon they talk about one nature rather than two but the issue seems to be one of terminology rather than substance clh

 from hall vice ico tek com hal f lillywhite subject eternal marriage was mormon temples organization tektronix inc beaverton or lines six five in article dhammers pacific david hammerslag writes this paragraph brought to mind a question how do you mormons reconcile the idea of eternal marriage with christ s statement that in the ressurection people will neither marry nor be given in marriage luke chapt two zero well here is something i wrote some time ago in response to a similar question i hope it helps begin repeat of previous post as for the scripture mentioned i agree that it does seem to be a problem not only for eternal marriage but marriage in general luke s version has jesus saying that the children of this world marry and are given in marriage but not those who will attain the kingdom of heaven it almost sounds like marriage disqualifies one for salvation matthew and mark both omit this statement i think the accounts are not as clear as they might be let s have a look at the incident and see if we can come up with some reasonable ideas of what it means the scriptures involved are mat two two two three three zero mark one two one eight two five and luke two zero two seven three six what happened was that the sadducees who did not believe in the resurrection thought they could trap jesus they made reference to the leverite marriage which required the brother of a man who died without children to take the widow to wife and raise up children the children would be considered children of the deceased just as though the woman s first husband had fathered them it seems obvious from this that the woman was still considered in a way to be the wife of her first husband however the sadducees concocted a scene in which six brothers of the deceased each in his turn failed to father children by the widow they seem to imply that the leverite marriage was equal to the first for they ask whose wife shall she be in the resurrection at this point it seems obvious that if she is anybody s wife it is the first husband after all had she borne children they would have been credited to him regardless of which brother was the biological father it is possible jesus was refering to this when he says ye do err not knowing the scriptures or the power of god mat two two two nine compare mark one two two four phrase not in luke s account anyway the sadducees ask whose wife will she be in the resurrection seeing that all seven had her jesus answer is that in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage mat two two three zero when they rise from the dead they neither marry mark one two two five they which are accounted worthy to obtain that world neither marry luke two zero three five all three accounts go on to say but are as the angels in heaven or the equivalent i find this last not very helpful since the bible does not define angels nor give any idea what their life is like some ministers claim that they are sexless different that humans etc but i can find no biblical support for this i think what jesus is saying here and it is clearest in matthew s and mark s accounts is that marriages will not be performed in the resurrection this goes along with our belief that if a person is to marry at all it must be done on this earth however we do believe that a marriage performed by the authority of god can be binding in eternity in fact the first marriage appears to have been performed by god himself before death entered the world in the garden of eden what therefore god hath joined together let not man put asunder mat one nine six jesus also told peter and the other apostles that whatsoever they should bind on earth should be bound in heaven mat one six one nine one eight one eight i believe that this also refers to marriages performed by the proper authority

 from mserv mozart cc iup edu mail server subject christian homosexuality part two of two lines two two six this is a continuation of an earlier post mls panix com michael siemon writes for those christians who do think that some parts of leviticus can be law for christians while others are not even to be thought about it is incumbent on you in every case handled on its own merits to determine why you pick one and ignore another i frankly think the whole effort misguided reread paul no doubt i am free to do anything but christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this the great commandment of love for god and neighbor if you cannot go through leviticus and decide each command there on that basis then your own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy in this context it is remarkably offensive to say i notice that the verse forbidding bestiality immediately follows the verse prohibiting what appears to be homosexual intercourse i am sorry you found this offensive it was not my intent to offend i was leading up to another point which i discuss in more detail below well la ti da so what this is almost as slimey an argument as the one that homosexuality rape i know of no one who argues seriously though one can always find jokers in defense of bestiality it is absolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay christians do raise which concern sexual activity within committed consensual human adult realtionships so that your bringing it up is no more relevant than the laws of kashrut if you cannot address the actual issues you are being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the world if you want to address bestiality that is your business not mine and attempting to torpedo a serious issue by using what is in our culture a ridiculous joke shows that you have no interest in hearing us as human beings you want to dismiss us and use the sleaziest means you can think of to do so i can see you have a revulsion for bestiality that far exceeds my distaste for homosexuality certainly if i spoke about homosexuality the way you speak of bestiality nobody would have any trouble labelling me a homophobe let me ask this gently why are you so judgemental of other people s sexual preferences what happened to no doubt i am free to do anything i think you have a serious double standard here when you describe a comparison between homosexuality and bestiality as slimey and sleazy you are making an implicit judgement that bestiality is perverted sinful disgusting unnatural in short all the things that society once thought about homosexuality not all people share your view you claim not to know any sincere zoophiles but this does not mean that they do not exist they even have their own newsgroup alt sex bestiality are you going to accuse them all of being mere jokers i notice you deleted the main point of my comment the fact that the only biblical condemnations of bestiality occur in connection with the levitical prohibitions against homosexuality while there are some new testament passages that can arguably be taken as condemning homosexuality there are none that condemn bestiality one of your main points seems to be that christian homosexuality is acceptable due to the lack of any clear new testament statements against it if this is a valid argument then should not christian zoophilia be made that much more acceptable by the fact that the new testament makes no reference clear or unclear to the subject at all i am quite serious here if i am going to accept homosexuality as biblically acceptable on the basis of your arguments then i am going to be fair and apply the same standards to everyone else s declared sexual preferences as well if the arguments you make for homosexuality can be applied to other sexual preferences as well i m going to apply them and see what comes up i m not trying to torpedo a serious issue by using what you label a ridiculous joke i posted a question about how we should interpret biblical guidelines for christian sexuality and i don t think such a question is irrelevant in a group called soc religion christian the bible discusses homosexuality and bestiality together in the same context and therefore i feel i have a good precedent for doing the same jesus and paul both expound very explictly and in considerable length the central linch pin of christian moral thought we are required to love one another and all else depends on that gay and lesbian christ ians challenge you to address the issue on those terms and all we get in return are cheap debate tricks attempting to side track the issues i don t know whether it makes any difference but for the record this is not a side issue for me i believe loving one another includes not encouraging people to defile themselves therefore it is of high importance to determine whether god regards certain sexual acts as defiling i can read in the new testament that god has joined together heterosexual couples and that the marriage bed is undefiled i can read in the old testament that homosexual intercourse and bestiality defile a person whether or not that person is under the law if gay christians can validly put aside the old testament standards of defilement then i want to know so that i can fairly apply it to all the sexual practices that defiled a person in the old days i don t think it s right to take just bits and pieces of the law and try and apply them to christians today e g bestiality still defiles you but homosexuality doesn t that was pretty much what you said earlier right you used different examples but i think you said essentially the same thing about it being wrong to apply only certain parts of the law to christians christians no doubt very sincere ones keep showing up here and in every corner of usenet and the world and all they ever do is spout these same old verses which they obviously have never thought about maybe never even read in total ignorance of the issues raised slandering us with the vilest charges of child abuse or whatever their perfervid minds can manage to conjure up tossing out red herrings with they suppose great emotional force to cause readers to dismiss our witness without even taking the trouble to find out what it is it was not my intent to stir up such an emotional reaction i personally don t get all that upset discussing alternatives to the monogamous heterosexual orientation i m afraid i naively assumed that others would have a similar attitude please note that i have never intended to equate homosexuality with child abuse i have merely noted that for all the lack of clear nt condemnation of homosexuality there is an even greater lack of nt condemnation or even mention of bestiality a practice which a number of people e g on alt sex bestiality consider to be their true sexual orientation such behavior should shame anyone who claims to have seen truth in christ why for god s precious sake do you people quote irrelevant verses to condemn people you don t know and won t even take the trouble to listen to before you start your condemnations is that loving your neighbor god forbid is that how you obey the repeated commands to not judge or condemn others christ and paul spend orders of magnitude more time in insisting on this than the half dozen obscure words in paul that you are so bloody ready to take as license to do what god tells you not to do why for god s sake quote from john three one seven ff omitted for brevity this is an excellent question and i pray that you will not treat it as a mere rhetorical question but will genuinely seek to discover and understand the answer i recommend you begin with a little introspection into why you yourself have much the same attitude towards zoophilia why do you find bestiality so repugnant that you regard it as slanderous to even mention in connection with other alternative sexual orientations why do you not apply all the same verses about love and tolerance to zoophiles the way you apply them to homosexuals is it because you automatically experience a subjective feeling of revulsion at the thought a lot of people have the same experience at the thought of homosexual intercourse is it because you regard the practice as socially unacceptable a lot of people regard homosexuality as socially unacceptable do you feel that it violates the traditional judeo christian standard of sexual morality many people feel that homosexuality does do you feel the bible condemns it many people think the bible says more to condemn homosexuality than it does to condemn bestiality why then do you think comparing bestiality with homosexuality is insulting to homosexuality if you can honestly answer this question you will have come a long way towards understanding why many people feel the same way about homosexuality as you feel about bestiality also please note that i am not in any sense condemning people i am merely pointing out that when i read the bible i see certain sexual practices that the bible appears to condemn e g sex outside of marriage when i say i think adultery and pre marital sex are sinful do you take that as me failing to love my neighbor when you treat bestiality as something disgusting and unmentionable are you disobeying repeated orders not to judge or condemn others when you say other christians are guilty of sinning by condemning you and judging you are you by that accusation making yourself guilty of the same offense or are you and i both simply taking note about practices the bible brands as sinful and leaving the judgement of the people up to god for long ages we many of us have been confused by evil counsel from evil men and told that if we came to the light we would be shamed and rejected some of us despaired and took to courses that probably do show a sinful shunning of god s light blessed are those whose spirits have been crushed by the self righteous they shall be justified however we have seen the truth and the truth is the light of humanity and we now know that it is not we who fear the light but our enemies who fear the light of our witness and will do everything they can to shadow it with the darkness of false witness against us michael l siemon i say you are gods sons of the mls panix com most high all of you nevertheless or you shall die like men and fall mls ulysses att com like any prince psalm eight two six seven i m not sure what you mean by the above two paragraphs if you mean that jesus is the truth and that he accepts sinners and does not reject them then i agree if we were not sinners then we would not need a savior our salvation in christ however does not mean that sin is now irrelevant for us and we can now do whatever we want nor does christ s grace mean that those who refer to sin as sin are being judgemental or intolerant i am speaking in general terms here not specifically about homosexuality if the bible calls something sin then it is not unreasonable for christians to call it sin too as applied to christian homosexuality i think the only definitive authority on christian sexuality is the bible if you make a list of everything the bible says on the subject of homosexual intercourse i think you will find that every verse on the list is negative and condemning at worst and unclear at best the most pro gay statement you could make about the list is that there is some dispute about the new testament verses which many people interpret as condemning homosexual intercourse that is from a gay perspective the most positive thing you can say about the bible s treatment of homosexuality is that some verses fail to clearly condemn it that s it jesus declared all foods clean the council at jerusalem declared that gentiles were not required to keep the ritual law but nobody ever reclassified homosexual intercourse from being an abomination deserving of death to being an accepted christian practice you have verses describing homosexual intercourse as an abomination that defiles both jews under the law and gentiles not under the law and you have some verses which are at best not clear but which some people believe are clear in their condemnation of homosexual behavior and that s the sum total of what the bible says about same sex intercourse i can appreciate from personal experience your desire to have everything simple cut and dried black and white what i want is ok and those who oppose me are wicked however i do not think the bible makes your case as definitively as you would like it to in fact i don t believe it says anything positive about your case at all yes i know the verses about loving one another and not judging one another but that s not really the issue is it you know and admit that there are still things that are sinful for christians to do since you say it is wrong for christians to condemn you therefore the issue is whether the bible says homosexual intercourse is a sin even if you do challenge the clarity of the new testament verses you are still left with the fact that the only thing the bible does say clearly about homosexual intercourse is that it is an abomination that defiles both those who are under the law and those who are not mark actually i don t think the reaction to the comparision with bestiality is based on bestialophobia i think what he regards as slimey is the rhetorical approach of connecting homosexuality and bestiality most people who accept homosexuality take a radical approach to the law they regard all of lev as not binding on christians the argument is that there s no way in the text to separate bestiality homosexuality and wearing mixed fabrics this does not mean that such people have no limits on their conduct nor does it mean that they accept bestiality it simply means that their sexual ethics does not come from the law and particularly not from lev clh

 from mserv mozart cc iup edu mail server subject christian homosexuality part one of two lines two eight eight note i am breaking this reply into two parts due to length mls panix com michael siemon writes in article mserv mozart cc iup edu someone named mark writes mls panix com michael siemon writes homosexual christians have indeed checked out these verses some of them are used against us only through incredibly perverse interpretations others simply do not address the issues i can see that some of the above verses do not clearly address the issues there are exactly zero verses that clearly address the issues i agree that there are no verses that have gone unchallenged by gay rights activists but if there are zero verses that clearly address the issues doesn t that mean that there are also no verses that clearly support your case are you sure you want to say that there are zero verses that clearly address the issues however a couple of them seem as though they do not require incredibly perverse interpretations in order to be seen as condemning homosexuality the kind of interpretation i see as incredibly perverse is that applied to the story of sodom as if it were a blanket equation of homosexual behavior and rape since christians citing the bible in such a context should be presumed to have at least read the story it amounts to slander a charge that homosexuality rape to use that against us the story in genesis one nine tells of the citizens of sodom demanding an opportunity to know the two men who were lot s guests the fact that the sodomites became angry when lot offered them his daughters could be seen as indicating that they were interested only in homosexual intercourse yes what they wanted was rape homosexual rape and everybody agrees that that is wrong some christians believe that the homosexual aspect of their desire was just as sinful as the rape aspect of their desire the passage does not say what it was that so offended god whether it was the homosexuality or the intended rape or both but i believe that it is only fair to consider all the possible alternatives in the light of related scriptures i do not believe that those who believe god was offended by both the homosexuality and the rape are trying to say that homosexuality is itself a form of rape you seems to take the view that the only sin described in gen one nine is in the fact that the sodomites wanted to commit rape and that it is unfair to stigmatize their homosexuality by associating it with the sin of rape i can see how you might reach such a conclusion if you started from the conclusion that there is nothing wrong with homosexuality but then again we re not supposed to start from our conclusions because that s circular reasoning if god is in fact opposed to homosexual intercourse in general then the more probably interpretation is that he was at least as offended by the sodomites blatant homosexuality as he was by their intent to commit rape later on i will document why i believe the old testament portrays god as one who despises any homosexual intercourse even if both partners are consenting adults do not be deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers nor effeminate nor homosexuals nor thieves nor the covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor swindlers shall inherit the kingdom of god and such were some of you i cor six nine one one the moderator adequately discusses the circularity of your use of porneia in this the moderator found my proposal to be circular in that he regarded the church as the proper authority for determining what kinds of marriages would be legitimate and thus the church s refusal to recognize perverted marriages was circular reasoning my questions however had nothing to do with the church ordaining new kinds of marriages and so his argument was something of a straw man in terms of my original question the precise definition translation of porneia isn t really important unless you are trying to argue that the bible doesn t really condemn extramarital sex i m not sure the moderator was trying to do that in any case i think both you and the moderator have missed the point here when jesus was asked about divorce he replied have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and the two shall become one flesh consequently they are no longer two but one flesh what therefore god has joined together let no man separate mt one nine four six i read here that the sexual union of a man male and his wife female is a divinely ordained union in other words the institution of heterosexual marriage is something ordained and established by god not by men and not by the church but by god men are not supposed to dissolve this union in jesus words because it is not something created by men this is not circular reasoning this is just reading god s word i read in the bible that god ordained the union of male and female i do not read of any similar divinely ordained union of two males or two females granted there have been uninspired men who have ordained alternative unions isn t caligula reported to have married his horse but the only union that jesus refers to as what god has joined together is the heterosexual union of a man and his wife pardon me for mentioning caligula i know that s probably inflammatory and i should save it for the discussion on bestiality in part two of this post please hold off on passing judgement on me until you have read that section of my reply anyway my original question was not whether we should translate porneia in a way that condemns only a select few kinds of extramarital sex my question was given that heterosexual marriage is the only union described by the bible as divinely ordained and given a biblical prohibition against sex outside of marriage is homosexual intercourse sinful of course i see now that first we need to ask whether the bible really condemns sex outside of marriage you seem to be trying to argue that only certain kinds of extramarital sex and other sins are really wrong i think we can all agree with paul that there are some kinds of activity that could be named by fornication or theft or coveting or reviling or drunkenness which would well deserve condemnation we may or may not agree to the bounds of those categories however and the very fact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at all clear but that paul an excellent rhetorician had no interest in making them clear leaving matters rather to our spirit led decisions with all the uncomfortable living with other readings that has dominated christian discussion of all these areas alternatively it may be that the definition of such terms as porneia and all the rest was in paul s day what we would call a faq i e the law as the tutor appointed by god to lead us to christ had just spent some sixteen centuries drumming into the heads of god s people the idea that things like homosexual intercourse were abominations that deserved punishment by death perhaps paul didn t go into detail on what porneia c were because after one six zero zero years he considered the question to have been dealt with already perhaps the reason god s apostles and prophets did not devote a great deal of time defining a distinct new testament sexuality was because he did not intend any significant changes in the sexuality he had already established by the law i ll discuss the law and homosexuality in greater detail below but i just wanted to point out that the new testament s failure to develop a detailed new standard of sexuality is not necessarily evidence that god does not care about sexual conduct especially after one six zero zero years of putting people to death for practicing homosexuality homosexual behavior is no different i and the other gay christians i know are adamant in condemning rape heterosexual or homosexual and child molestation heterosexual or homosexual and even the possibly harmless but obsessive kinds of sex heterosexual or homosexual that would stand condemned by paul in the very continuation of the chapter you cite may i mildly suggest that what paul does in his letter that you want to use is perhaps a good guide to his meaning i am free to do anything you say yes but not everything is for my good no doubt i am free to do anything but i for one will not let anything make free with me one cor six one two which is a restatement that we must have no other god before god a commandment neither i nor any other gay christian wishes to break some people are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior it is just as wrong though slightly less incendiary so it s a secondary argument from the phobic contingent to equate homosexuality with such behavior as to equate it with the rape of god s messengers and how do you define an obsessively driven mode of sexual behavior how do you determine the difference between obsessive sexual behavior and normal sex drives is the desire to have sinful sex an obsessively driven mode of behavior i think you see that this is circular reasoning why is it defined as sinful because it is obsessive what makes it obsessive the fact that the person is driven to seek it even though it s sinful or is it obsessive because it is a desire for that which society condemns once again that s circular why is it defined as obsessive because the person wants it even though society condemns it why does society condemn it because it is obsessive you seem to be trying to limit the bible s condemnation of porneia to only perverted sex acts but i don t think you can really define perverted without falling into exactly the same circularity you accuse me of what then is paul condemning when he declares that fornicators shall not enter the kindgom of heaven i won t deal with the exegesis of leviticus except very tangentially fundamentally you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your assumption that you know what porneia means i think you misunderstood me i was not trying to make an argument on some technical definition of porneia i was raising the issues of the sinfulness of extramarital sex and the lack of any scriptural evidence of a homosexual counterpart to the divinely ordained union of heterosexual couples there are plenty of laws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in leviticus most of which christians ignore completely they never even bother to examine them they just assume that they know which ones are moral and which ones are ritual well i have news for you any anthropology course should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs unlcean as categories in an awful lot of societies we have them too but buried pretty deep and i cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of leviticus from the ritual law which no christian i know feels applies to us i m dead serious here when people start going on as they do in this matter about how repulsive and unnatural our acts are and what do they know about it huh it is a solid clue to the same sort of arbitrary cultural inculcations as the american prejudice against eating insects please remember what you just said here for when we discuss bestiality in part two on what basis other than assuming your conclusion can you say that the law against male male intercourse in leviticus is not a part of the ritual law i am glad you asked would you agree that if god condemns homosexual intercourse even among those who are not under the law of moses then this would show that god s condemnation of homosexual acts goes beyond the ritual law if i can show you from scripture that god punished the homosexual behavior of people who were not under the law of moses would you agree that god s definition of homosexual intercourse as an abomination is not limited to just the ritual law and those who are under the law i ve been having a private email discussion with a seven th day adventist on the subject of the sabbath and my main point against a christian sabbath keeping requirement has been that nowhere in scripture does god command gentiles to rest on the sabbath nor does he ever condemn gentiles for failing to rest on the sabbath this illustrates the difference between universal requirements such as thou shalt not kill and requirements that are merely part of the temporary jews only law of moses such as the sabbath the point you are trying to make is that you think the classification of homosexual intercourse as an abomination is just a part of the temporary jews only law of moses i on the other hand believe that it was labelled by god as an abomination for gentiles as well as jews and that he punished those guilty of this behavior by death or exile here s why back in genesis one five god promises to give abraham all the land that was then in the possession of the amorite kinda hard on the amorite don t you think but in verse one six we have a clue that this might not be as unjust as it sounds it seems god is going to postpone this takeover for quite a while because the iniquity of the amorite is not yet complete remember this is all long before there was a ritual law what then was the iniquity the amorite was committing that when complete would justify his being cast out of his own land and or killed go back and look at lev one eight again verses one two three list a variety of sins including child sacrifice incest homosexuality and bestiality beginning in verse two four god starts saying do not defile yourselves by any of these things for by all these things the nations which i am casting out before you have become defiled for the land has become defiled therefore i have visited its punishment upon it so the land has spewed out its inhabitants for whoever does any of these abominations those persons who do so shall be cut off from among their people notice that god says the gentile nations who are not under the ritual law of moses are about to be punished because they have defiled themselves and their land by committing abominations that include incest bestiality and homosexuality flip ahead two chapters to lev two zero and you will find these same abominations listed and this time god decrees the death penalty on anyone involved in any of these things including specifically a man lying with another man as one lies with a woman lv two zero one three their bloodguiltiness was upon them meaning that in god s eyes they deserved to die for having done such things according to lev one eight two six two nine even the alien non jew who sojourns among you was to refrain from these practices on penalty of being cut off by god from among their people under the circumstances i believe it would be very difficult to support the claim that in the old testament god objected only to the intended rape and not the homosexuality in sodom since god took the trouble to specifically list sex between two consenting men as one of the reasons for wiping out the canaanite nations not homosexual rape mind you but plain voluntary gay sex i d say god was not neutral on the subject of homosexual behavior even by those who had nothing to do with the mosaic covenant for those christians who do think that some parts of leviticus can be law for christians while others are not even to be thought about it is incumbent on you in every case handled on its own merits to determine why you pick one and ignore another according to ii tim three one six all scripture is inspired by god and is profitable for teaching reproof correction and training in righteousness thus i believe that even though we gentile christians are not under the law we can learn from studying it if a certain action is defined as a sin because it is a violation of the law then it is a sin only for those who are under the law for example in the case of sabbath keeping where god reveals that certain actions are abominations even for those who are not under the law then i conclude that god s objection to the practice is not based on whether or not a person is under the law but on the sinfulness of the act itself in the case of homosexuality homosexual intercourse is defined by god as a defiling abomination for gentiles as well as jews i e for those who are not under the law as well as for those who are thus i am not at all trying to say that gentile christians have any obligation to keep any part of the law i am simply saying that god referred to homosexuality as a sin even for those who are not obligated to keep the law if this is so then i do not think we can appeal to our exemption from the law as valid grounds for legitimizing a practice god has declared a bloodguilty abomination that defiles both jew and gentile continued in part two mark

 from rexlex fnal gov subject arsenokoitai scroggs three organization fnal ad net lines one nine nine cont dr james deyoung three r scroggs robin scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and suggested a new twist to the word scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a hellenistic jewish coinage perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic terminology the term is derived from lev one eight two two two zero one three where the lxx juxtaposes the two words arsenos male and koiten bed and represents the hebrew miskab zabar lying with a male yet he believes that paul did not originate the term but borrowed it from circles of hellenistic jews acquainted with rabbinic discussions one eight zero n one four it was invented to avoid contact with the usual greek terminology one zero eight if this is true scroggs observes it explains why the word does not appear in greco roman discussions of pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it it was meaningless to native speaking greeks one zero eight scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the object of the second part thus differing from boswell s learned discussion one zero seven yet scroggs understands the general meaning of one who lies with a male to have a very narrow reference with the preceding malokoi i cor six nine which scroggs interprets as the effeminate call boy arsenokoitai is the active partner who keeps the malakos of the mistress or who hires him on occasion to satisfy his sexual desires one zero eight hence arsenokoitai does not refer to homosexuality in general to female homosexuality or to the generic model of pederasty it certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model he affirms one zero nine this is scrogg s interpretation of the term in i tim one one zero also the combination of pornoi fornicators arsenokoitai and andrapodistai slave dealers refers to male prostitutes males who lie with them and slave dealers who procure them one two zero it again refers to that specific form of pederasty which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual purposes and the use of these boys by adult males one two one even serious minded pagan authors condemned this form of pederasty he then uses these instances of arsenokoitai in i cor and i tim to interpret the apparently general condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in rom one consequently paul must have had could only have had pederasty in mind one two two we cannot know what paul would have said about the contemporary model of adult adult mutuality in same sex relation ships one two two in relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical concerns scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of vices in i cor six have no deliberate intended meaning in paul the form and function of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped any relationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually nonexistent he concludes that paul does not care about any specific item in the lists one zero four both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary phenomenon of a catalogue of vices scroggs argues that the scriptures are irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today one two nine the model in today s christian homosexual community is so different from the model attacked by the nt that biblical judgments against homosexuality are not relevant to today s debate they should no longer be used in denominational discussions about homosexuality should in no way be a weapon to justify refusal of ordination one two seven reactions to the new interpretations of arsenokoitai d wright in more recent years the positions of bailey boswell and scroggs have come under closer scrutiny perhaps the most critical evaluation of boswell s view is that by david wright in his thorough article wright points out several shortcomings of boswell s treatment of arsenokoitai he faults boswell for failing to cite or citing inaccurately all the references to lev one eight two two and two zero one three in the church fathers such as eusebius the apostolic constitutions clement of alexandria tertullian and origen one two seven two eight boswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term derives either its form or its meaning from the leviticus passages one two nine this is significant for if the term is so derived it clearly refutes boswell s claim that the first half of the word arseno denotes not the object but the gender of the second half koitai the lxx must mean a male who sleeps with a male making arseno the object wright also faults boswell s claims regarding linguistic features of the term including suggested parallels one two nine though boswell claims that compounds with arseno employ it objectively and those with arreno employ it as an adjective wright believes that the difference between the two is merely one of dialectical diversity no semantic import attaches to the difference between the two forms one three one wright believes that in most compounds in which the second half is a verb or has a verbal force the first half denotes its object and where the second part is substantival the first half denotes its gender one three two it is with boswell s treatment of the early church fathers that wright takes special issue because the former has failed to cite all the sources for example aristides apology c ad one three eight probably uses arrenomaneis androbaten and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male homosexuality one three three contrary to boswell s discussion boswell fails to cite hippolytus refut omn haer five two six two two two three and improperly cites eusebius and the syriac writer bardensanes the latter uses syriac terms that are identical to the syriac of i cor six nine and i tim one one zero one three three three four next wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in parallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers the dominant form of male homosexuality among the greeks one three four sometimes this parallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia adultery porneia fornication and paidophthoria with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris one three six clement of alexandria in protr one zero one zero eight five cites the second table of the ten commandments as you shall not kill ou moicheuseis you shall not commit adultery ou paidophthoreseis you shall not practice homosexuality with boys you shall not steal one five zero n four three another occurrence of arsenokoitein commit homosexuality exists in the sibylline oracles two seven one seven three it may be wright observes that the word was coined by a jewish pre christian writer in a hellenistic setting represented by or sib book two one three seven three eight wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in rhetorius six th c who drew upon the first century ad writer teucer in macarius four th five th c and in john the faster d five nine five one three nine four zero the last in particular bears the idea of homosexual intercourse contrary to boswell wright next replies to boswell s contention that the term would not be absent from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted one four zero four one wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to the first century ad since it did not exist before then that the greeks used dozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality that some sources e g didache show no acquaintance with paul s letters or deliberately avoid citing scripture and that boswell neglects citing several church fathers one four zero four one boswell s treatment of chrysostom in particular draws wright s attention one four one four four boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of chrysostom omitting references and asserting what is patently untrue chrysostom gives a long uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on rom one two six boswell has exaggerated chrysostom s infrequent use of the term wright observes that boswell has signally failed to demonstrate any us of arsenokoites etc in which it patently does not denote male homosexual activity one four four it is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature and the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly specified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the greco roman world wright also surveys the latin syriac and coptic translations of i tim and i cor all three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning homosexual i e they understand arseno as the object of the second half of the word one four four four five none of these primary versions supports boswell s limited conclusion based on them wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the catalogues of vices as a literary form he believes that such lists developed in late judaism as hellenistic jews wrote in clear condemnation of homosexuality in the greek world this paralleled the increased concern on the part of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence the term came into being under the influence of the lxx one four five so that writers spoke generally of male activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual engagement with paides one four six if arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were interchangeable it is because the former encompassed the latter one four six in summary wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning homosexuality and arises with judaism the views of boswell scroggs and others who limit the term to active male prostitutes or pederasty are without

theism is strongly correlated with irrational belief in absolutes irrational belief in absolutes is strongly correlated with fanatism deletion theism is correlated with fanaticism i have neither said that all fanatism is caused by theism nor that all theism leads to fanatism the point is theism increases the chance of becoming a fanatic one could of course argue that would be fanatics tend towards theism for example but i just have to loook at the times in history when theism was the dominant ideology to invalidate that conclusion that that is the basic mechanism behind it imo the influence of stalin or for that matter ayn rand invalidates your assumption that theism is the factor to be considered bogus i just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism the point is that theism is a factor that s your claim now back it up i consider your argument as useful as the following belief is strongly correlated with fanaticism therefore belief is a factor in fanaticism true and utterly useless note this is any belief not belief in gods gullibility blind obedience to authority lack of scepticism and so on are all more reliable indicators and the really dangerous people the sources of fanaticism are often none of these things they are cynical manipulators of the gullible who know precisely what they are doing that s a claim you have to support please note that especially in the field of theism the leaders believe what they say if you believe that you re incredibly naive now some brands of theism and more precisely some theists do tend to fanaticism i grant you to tar all theists with this brush is bigotry not a reasoned argument and it reads to me like a warm up for censorship and restriction of religious freedom ever read animal farm that s a straw man and as usually in discussions with you one has to repeat it read what i have written above not every theism leads to fanatism and not all fanatism is caused by theism the point is there is a correlation and it comes from innate features of theism no some of it comes from features which some theism has in common with some fanaticism your last statement simply isn t implied by what you say before because you re trying to sneak in innate features of all theism the word you re groping for is some gullibility by the way is one of them no shit sherlock so why not talk about gullibility instead of theism since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have as opposed to the case you are trying to make and to say that i am going to forbid religion is another of your straw men interesting that you have nothing better to offer i said it reads like a warm up to that that s because it s an irrational and bogus tirade and has no other use than creating a nice them us split in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either side of church walls two define irrational belief e g is it rational to believe that reason is always useful irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason the latter has been discussed for a long time with charley wingate one point is that the beliefs violate reason often and another that a process that does not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable information well there is a glaring paradox here an argument that reason is useful based on reason would be circular and argument not based on reason would be irrational which is it that s bogus self reference is not circular and since the evaluation of usefulness is possible within rational systems it is allowed o k it s oval it s still begging the question however and though that certainly is allowed it s not rational and you claiming to be rational and all at the risk of repeating myself and hearing we had that before we didn t hear a refutation before so we re back deal with it you can t use reason to demonstrate that reason is useful someone who thinks reason is crap won t buy it you see your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics and mathematics are therfore circular anybody else think godel was silly the first part of the second statement contains no information because you don t say what the beliefs are if the beliefs are strong theism and or strong atheism then your statement is not in general true the second part of your sentence is patently false counterexample an axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis but is assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is used to obtain it i ve been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions of god here an axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis what you say here is a an often refuted fallacy have a look at the discussion of the axiom of choice and further one can evaluate axioms in larger systems out of which they are usually derived i exist is derived if you want it that way further one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms what is it you are trying to say that at some point people always wind up saying this datum is reliable for no particular reason at all example i am not dreaming compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational i can t agree with this until you are specific which theism to say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which i suspect you do not have using the traditonal definition of gods personal supernatural entities with objective effects on this world usually connected to morals and or the way the world works imo any belief about such gods is necessarily irrational that does not mean that people who hold them are in principle opposed to the exercise of intelligence some atheists are also scientists for example the affinity to fanatism is easily seen it has to be true because i believe it is nothing more than a work hypothesis however the beliefs say they are more than a work hypothesis i don t understand this can you formalise your argument person a believes system b becuase it sounds so nice that does not make b true it is at best a work hypothesis however the content of b is that it is true and that it is more than a work hypothesis testing or evaluating evidence for or against it therefore dismissed because b already believed says it is wrong a waste of time not possible depending on the further contents of b amalekites idolaters protestants are to be killed this can have interesting effects peculiar definition of interesting but sure now show that a belief in gods entails the further contents of which you speak why aren t my catholic neighbours out killing the protestants for example maybe they don t believe in it maybe it s the conjunction of b asserts b and jail kill dissenters that is important and the belief in gods is entirely irrelevant it certainly seems so to me but then i have no axe to grind here frank o dwyer i m not hatching that odwyer sse ie from hens by evelyn

 from nyeda cnsvax uwec edu david nye subject re after two zero zero zero years can we say that christian morality is organization university of wisconsin eau claire lines six two reply to frank d zero one two s six five eight uucp frank o dwyer the problem for the objectivist is to determine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be established if we accept that such judgements are not reports of what is but only relate to what ought to be see naturalistic fallacy then they cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world this can be avoided in at least two ways one by leaving the good undefined since anyone who claims that they do not know what it is is either lying or so out of touch with humanity as to be undeserving of a reply if the good is undefined undefinable but you require of everyone that they know innately what is right you are back to subjectivism two by defining the good solely in terms of evaluative terms ditto here an evaluative statement implies a value judgement on the part of the person making it at this point the objectivist may talk of self evident truths pretty perceptive that prof flew but can he deny the subjectivist s claim that self evidence is in the mind of the beholder of course by denying that subject object is true dichotomy please explain how this helps i don t see your argument if not what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true if nothing then no moral judgements are true this is a thing that is commonly referred to as nihilism it entails that science is of no value irrepective of the fact that some people find it useful how anyone arrives at relativism subjectivism from this argument beats me this makes no sense either flew is arguing that this is where the objectivist winds up not the subjectivist furthermore the nihilists believed in nothing except science materialism revolution and the people the subjectivist may well feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements with which he would wish to associate himself to hold a moral opinion is he suggests not to know something to be true but to have preferences regarding human activity and if those preferences should include terrorism that moral opinion is not true likewise if the preferences should include noterrorism that moral opinion is not true why should one choose a set of preferences which include terrorisim over one which includes noterrorism oh no reason this is patently absurd and also not the position of the subjectivist as has been pointed out to you already by others ditch the strawman already and see my reply to mike cobb s root message in the thread societal basis for morality david nye nyeda cnsvax uwec edu midelfort clinic eau claire wi this is patently absurd but whoever wishes to become a philosopher must learn not to be frightened by absurdities bertrand russell

na lines one four two andrew newell tan one zero two psuvm psu edu wrote i think you re letting atheist mythology confuse you on the issue of webster myth a traditional or legendary story a belief whose truth is accepted uncritically how does that qualify indeed it s almost oxymoronic a rather amusing instance i ve found that most atheists hold almost no atheist views as accepted uncritically especially the few that are legend many are trying to explain basic truths as myths do but they don t meet the other criterions andrew the myth to which i refer is the convoluted counterfeit athiests have created to make religion appear absurd rather than approach religion including christainity in a rational manner and debating its claims as the are stated atheists concoct outrageous parodies and then hold the religious accountable for beliefs they don t have what is more accurately oxymoric is the a term like reasonable atheist bill divine justice according to the most fundamental doctrines of christianity when the first man sinned he was at that time the you accuse him of referencing mythology then you procede to launch your own xtian mythology this time meeting all the requirements of myth here s a good example of of what i said above read the post again i said acoording to which means i am referring to christian doctrine as i understand it if i am speaking for myself you ll know it my purpose in posting was to present a basic overview of christain doctrines since it seemed germane bill with those who pretend not to know what is being said and what it means when atheists claim that they do not know if god exists and don t know what he wants they contradict the bible which clearly says that everyone knows the authority of the bible is its claim to be should i repeat what i wrote above for the sake of getting it across you may trust the bible but your trusting it doesn t make it any more credible to me if the bible says that everyone knows that s clearly reason to doubt the bible because not everyone knows your alleged god s alleged existance again i am paraphrasing christian doctrine which is very clear on this point your dispute is not with me bill refuted while the species wide condemnation is justified those that claim that there is no evidence for the existence of god or that his will is unknown must deliberately ignore the bible the ignorance itself is no excuse one no they don t have to ignore the bible the bible is far from universally accepted the bible is not a proof of god it is only a proof that some people have thought that there was a god or does it prove even that they might have been writing it as series of fiction short stories as in the case of dionetics assuming the writers believed it the only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it and that s ignoring the problem of whether or not all the interpretations and biblical philosophers were correct two there are people who have truly never heard of the bible three again read the faq one here again you miss the point the bible itself is not the point it s what it contains it makes no difference who accpets the bible or even who s unaware of its existence christians hold that it applies universally because mankind shares the same nature and the same fate and the same innate knowledge of god two see above three if you read my post with same care as read the faq we wouldn t be having this conversation bill freedom you are free to ignore god in the same way you are free to ignore gravity and the consequences are inevitable and well known in both cases that an atheist can t accept the evidence means only bzzt wrong answer gravity is directly there it doesn t stop exerting a direct and rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it god on the other hand doesn t generally show up in the supermarket except on the tabloids god doesn t exert a rationally undeniable influence gravity is obvious gods aren t as i said the evidence is there you just don t accept it here at least we agree bill secondly human reason is very comforatble with the concept of god so much so that it is in itself intrinsic to our nature human reason always comes back to the question of god in every generation and in no human reason hasn t always come back to the existance of god it has usually come back to the existance of god in other words it doesn t generally come back to the xtian god it comes back to whether there is any god and in much of oriental philosophic history it generally doesn t pop up as the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces are and which ones are out there from a world wide view human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to be and or what force s are currently in control a natural tendancy to believe in god only exists in religious wishful thinking yes human reason does always come back to the existence of god we re having this discussion are we not bill i said all this to make the point that christianity is eminently reasonable that divine justice is just and human nature is much different than what atheists think it is whether you agree or not you certainly are not correct on human nature you are at the least basing your views on a completely eurocentric approach try looking at the outside world as well when you attempt to sum up all of humanity well this is interesting truth is to be determined by it politically correct content granted it s extremely unhip to be a wasp male and anything european is contemptable but i thought this kind of dialogue the purpose of a a was to get at the truth of things but then i remember the oxymoron reasonalble atheist and i understand bill

silver the price of him that was valued whom they of the children of israel did value zechariah one one one one one three nothing in jeremiah remotely like what was the color of the robe placed on jesus during his trial scarlet matthew two seven two eight purple john one nine two the time of the crucifiction mark says the third hour or nine a m but john says the sixth hour noon was when the sentence was passed inscription on the cross matthew this is jesus the king of the jews mark the king of the jews luke this is the king of the jews john jesus of nazareth the king of the jews what did they give him to drink vinegar matthew two seven three four wine with myrrh mark one five two three women at the cross matthew said many stood far off including mary magdaline mary the mother of james and the mother of zebedee s children mark and luke speak of many far off and mark includes mary magdeline and mary the mother of james the less john says that jesus s mother stood at the cross along with her sister and mary magdalene jesus last words matt two seven four six five zero and about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice saying eli eli lama sabachthani that is to say my god my god why hast thou forsaken me jesus when he cried again with a loud voice yielded u the ghost luke two three four six and when jesus had cried with a loud voice he said father unto thy hands i commend my spirit and having said thus he gave up the ghost john one nine three zero when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost events of the crucifiction matthew says that the veil of the temple was rent that there was an earthquake and that it was dark from the sixth to the ninth hour that graves opened and bodies of the saints arose and went into jeruselem appearing to many beating jesus to the resurection mark and luke speak of darkness and the veil of the temple being rent but mention no earthquake or risen saints john is the only one who mentions jesus s side being peirced burial of jesus matthew says the jews asked pilate for a guard to prevent the body from being stolen by the disciples and for the tomb to be sealed all of this was supposedly done but the other gospels do not mention these precautions how long was jesus in the tomb depends where you look matthew one two four zero gives jesus prophesying that he will spend three days and three nights in the heart of the earth and mark one zero three four has after three days meta treis emeras he will rise again as far as i can see from a quick look the prophecies have after three days but the post resurrection narratives have on the third day time of the resurection matthew says sunday at dawn mark says the sun was rising and john says it was dark who was at the empty tomb is it mat two eight one in the end of the sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week came mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulchre mar one six one and when the sabbath was past mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and salome had bought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him joh two zero one the first day of the week cometh mary magdalene early when it was yet dark unto the sepulchre and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre whom did they see at the tomb mat two eight two and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it mat two eight three his countenance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow mat two eight four and for fear of him the keepers did shake and became as dead men mat two eight five and the angel answered and said unto the women fear not ye for i know that ye seek jesus which was crucified mar one six five and entering into the sepulchre they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were affrighted luk two four four and it came to pass as they were much perplexed thereabout behold two men stood by them in shining garments joh two zero one two and seeth two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of jesus had lain belief that the disciples stole jesus s body matthew says the guard was paid to tell this story but no other gospel makes this claim appearences of the risen jesus matthew says an angel at the tomb told the two marys and that jesus also told them to tell the disciples to meet him in galilee the disciples then went to a mountain previously agreed opon and met jesus there this was his only appearance except to the women at the tomb matthew only devotes five verses to the visit with the disciples mark says that jesus walked with two of the disciples in the country and that they told the rest of the disciples who refused to believe later he appeared to the one one disciples at mealtime luke says two followers went the same day that jesus rose from the dead to emmaus a village eight miles from jeruselem and there jesus jioned them but was unrecognised while they ate a meal together that evening they finally recognised jesus whereopon he dissapeared returning at once to jeruselem they told the disciples of their experience and suddenly jesus appeared among them frightening them as they thought he was a spirit jesus then ate some fish and honey and then preached to them john says jesus appeared to the disciples the evening of the day he arrose in jeruselem where they were hiding he breathed the holy ghost opon them but thomas was not present and refused to believe eight days later jesus joined the disciples again at the same place and this time he convinced thomas once more jesus made an appearance to the disciples at the sea of tiberias but again was not recognised after telling them to cast their netson the other side of the boat jesus becomes known to them and prepares bread and fish for them they all eat together and converse the book of acts further adds to the confusion it says that jesus showed himself to the apostles for a period of four zero days after his resurection thus contradicting matthew mark luke and john and spoke to them of things pertaining to the kingdom of god and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud recieved him out of their sight and while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up two men stood by them in white apparel which also said ye men of galilee why stand ye gazing into heaven this same jesus which is taken from you into heaven shall so comein like manneras ye have seen him go into heaven acts one three one one paul outdoes every other authority by saying that jesus was seen by five zero zero persons between the time of the resurection and the assension although he does not say where he also claims that he himself as one born out of due time also saw jesus one cor one five six eight the ascension matthew says nothing about it mark casually says that jesus was recieved into heaven after he was finished talking with the disciples in jeruselem luke says jesus led the desciples to bethany and that while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven john says nothing about it acts contradicts all of the above see previous section when second coming mat two four three four verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled mar one three three zero verily i say unto you that this generation shall not pass till all these things be done luk two one three two verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled one thessalonians four one five one eight how many apostles were in office between the resurection and ascention one corinthians one five five one two matthew two seven three five minus one from one two acts one nine two six mathias not elected until after resurrection mat two eight one six then the eleven disciples went away into galilee into a mountain where jesus had appointed them ascend to heaven and elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven two kings two one one no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven the son of man john three one three as you can see there are a number of contradictions in the account of the trial crucifiction and resurection of jesus if these are good witnesses you would think that they could get some of these important details right in fact i cannot find very many points on where they agree you would think that they could at least agree on some of the points they were supposedly observing because of the fact that there is so much contradiction and error the story of the resurection as presented cannot be taken as literal truth due to the nature of the story i doubt if it should be taken as any sort of truth alan

one apr one nine nine three zero nine three eight four three gmt organization unorganized usenet postings uninc x news reader vms news one two four lines one five one in frank d zero one two s six five eight uucp writes deletia in case anybody hadn t noticed frank and i are debating objective morality and seemingly hitting semantics secondly how can i refute your definition i can only point up its logical implications and say that they seem to contradict the usage of the word objective in other areas indeed by your definition an objective x is an oxymoron for all x i have no quibble with that belief other than that it is useless and that objective is a perfectly good word it may be that being a non native english speaker i ve misunderstood your usage of objective and tried to debate something you don t assert my apologies i m at a loss to imagine what you really do mean though how many ages can the universe have and still be internally self consistent i d be amazed if it was more than one how many different moral systems can different members of society have indeed single individuals in some cases and humanity still stick together begging the question people can have many opinions about the age of the universe and humanity can still stick together you are saying that the universe has a real age independent of my beliefs about it why wrong point the age of the universe has no direct effect on humanity s sticking power in the way the moral system of a society can have i m saying the universe has a real age because i see evidence for it cosmology astronomy and so on i say this age is independent of people s opinions of it because i know different people have a lot of different opinions in the matter yet empirical tests consistently seem to give roughly the same results the age of the universe like most scientific facts can be emirically verified through means that ll give the same result no matter who performs the testing albeit there are error bars that may be on the largish side this assumes that the universe has a real age or any kind of reality which doesn t depend on what we think i can t see how it does that put a creationist to the task of performing the tests and calculations see to it s he makes no blatant errors in measuring or calculating and the result of the test will be the same why should an extreme biblical creationist give a rat s ass about the means of which you speak because logically consistent empirical tests contradict their opinion if those tests were just my opinion then their own tests which would then be their opinion would contradict mine even if we conducted said tests in identical manner no they don t which i take as showing these tests have some validity beyond our opinion of them i ve heard of no way to verify morality in a consistent way much less compute the errors of the measurement care to enlighten me the same is true of pain but painkillers exist and can be predicted to work with some accuracy better than a random guess map the activity of nerves and neural activity if you mean physical pain you have a sharp point i ll give you that but you still haven t given me a way to quantify morality i wrote elsewhere that morality should be hypotheses about observed value we agree hypotheses however can change i hold that there is no ultimate hypothesis of morality towards which these changes could gravitate but that they could be changed in any way imaginable producing different results suitable for different tasks or purposes if a moral system makes a prediction it will be better if that can be tested better and worse are almost always defined in the context of a moral system your prediction will always be correct within that moral system what you need now is an objective definition of good and bad i wish you luck people s ideas about the age of object x are not objective you can have any idea you like and i can t stop you universae and their ages is another ballgame they are what they are and if you dislike some detail of them that s a problem with your opinion of them sure assume an objective reality and you get statements like this isn t that what you re doing when assuming an objectively real morality besides what exactly is provably wrong with my statement i claim that morality is an opinion of ours and as such subjective and individual if i m wrong then some more or less objectively real thing exists which you label objective morality can you back up this positive claim of existence can you back up your positive claim above no that s because it s an assumption i make the same assumption about values on the basis that there is no logical difference between the two and the empirical basis of the two is precisely the same claiming there is no objective morality is suddenly a positive claim besides i think i can lend some credence to my claim ponder different individuals both fully functional as human beings and members of society but yet with wildly different moral codes if morality was objective at least one should be way off base but yet hir incorrect morality seems to function fine how come as for producing these individuals it might be easiest to pick them from different societies say an islamic one and some polynesian matrilineal system for example if such still exist deletia testing for footballs on desks now take a look at morality see anything if so please inform me which way to look and why to look that particular way as opposed to some other get my drift no just look are you claiming never to know what good means one thing is good under some circumstances because we wish to achieve some goal for some reason other times we wish to do something else and that thing is no longer so clearly good at all some things are hard to make good because we d seldom if ever wish to achieve the sort of goal mass murder would lead one into still the aztecs were doing fine until the spaniards wiped them out i almost always know what good means sometimes i even know why i never claim this good is thereby fixed in stone immutable that s a simple matter of proving the track record of the scientific method i think it s great and should be applied to values i may be completely wrong but that s what i conclude as a result of quite an amount of thought yes me too and i ve tried a thing or two down that line it doesn t

daughter and singing about santa claus wasn t your argument that there has to be more more than what more than we assume which is what exactly a most of the people i debate disagree with my premises hardly debate otherwise your favorite point that we sense so it hs to be there has been challenged more than once when i did it you said good question and did not address it i ve addressed it your caricature is not my favourite point needless to say at length in a previous outing and am currently discussing it with eric rescorla b there s little point in responding the same points everywhere i do my best to give everyone the courtesy of a reply you still repeat that point i do curious since i believe that was the first time i ve ever made it not that repetition would imply much more than your seeming inability to understand you ask me the same question i ll give you the same answer especially when in this case i know the answer to be true i do my best to give everyone the courtesy of a reply but if everyone is making the same points and i m pushed for time then i try to respond what i believe are the strongest formulations of those points if that doesn t include your post tough this is usenet and life is tough all over c since there s a great deal of responses this isn t always feasible i do my best to honestly answer questions put to me you drop out of debates with some posters and continue with others you appear with the same issue every n months and start the dicussion at the beginning again i ve only debated this issue twice in a a and occasionally in t a the first was in response to simon clippingdale s positive assertion that disagreement about moral values inexorably acknowledges that morals are relative it doesn t now simon has dropped out of the debate for some time i take that to mean that he is either busy or bored with the topic i certainly do not accuse him of dishonesty do you d i can t always understand what you say neither can t i understand you all the time usually one asks what the other side means usually one does usually you re clear but sometimes you aren t and i ask you what you mean other times you seem to get extremely uptight and i feel that i m debating against line noise sometimes i get tired and sometimes i have other things i d rather do again this is usenet and life is tough all over you re going to have to deal with it e you re starting to get personally insulting i may not even put your name in the hat in future that s supposed to be a threat no that s a simple statement and an assertion that i am not answerable to those who offer me baseless insults for example those who accuse me of lying about my personal beliefs while also complaining that i don t answer their questions like that you what you sense is evidence for the sensed to be there if only everything would be so easy what almost everyone senses is evidence for the sensed to be there because to all intents and purposes it is there we had that argument for one your claim that everyone senses it is not founded and you have been asked to give evidence for it often and then the correct statement would be it is reason to assume that it is there unless evidence against it has been found i have no problem with the second statement i have provided an argument that almost everyone senses that freedom is valuable the only cogent objection to this came from jon livesey and was offered by some other people too essentially that people disagree about fuzzy concepts such as freedom it s a good point and i m thinking about it your trick is to say i feel a is not right and so do many i know therefore a is absolutely right it neglects the possibility that these people consider a to be right as an effect of the same process restricting the claim of its absoluteness to those who have been subject of that process in other words refutes it you make the ontological claim you have to prove it nonsense my trick is to say i feel that a is better than b and so does almost any disinterested person i ask best evidence is therefore that a really is better than b subject to the assumption that we can establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by a and b and that the resulting system of values is self consistent now get this really is better is an idealisation a fictional model in the same sense that real material existence is a fictional model it may or may not correspond to something true it is nonetheless a useful assumption far more useful than the equally assumed relativist trick to wit i feel that a is better than b and so does almost any disinterested person i ask however if even one person disagrees that a is better than b or if even one person dissents from mutually agreed definitions of a and b then it is the case that b is better than a for that person and nothing more can be said i say this is useless because it inexorably implies that a supermajority seeking to maximise a cannot morally take action against someone seeking to maximise b e g a terrorist to do that would be to claim that a supermajority s carefully considered morality would be better than the terrorist s which would of course be true but a no no for an ethical relativist to claim that ethical relativism implies anything else is simply weasel words and an example of compartmentalisation to rival anything in the world of religion for a similar argument i sense morality is subjective it does not hurt me to do things that are considered to be objectively wrong by others if you mean that you do things that some others consider objectively wrong and it turns out not to be the case for you of course this is possible it is neither evidence for subjectivism nor evidence against objectivism except sometimes in a pragmatic sense it serves as a counterexample for that everything that is subject to judgements is absolute and as long as you don t provide evidence for that there is something universally agreed upon there is no reason to believe your hypothesis i ve done this freedom with the proviso that i still have to answer jon s objection that fuzzy concepts like freedom have no objective meaning further in order to make morality absolute universal or objective you would have to show that it is independent of humans or the attributes above look quite misleading not really what evidence is there that anything exists independently of humans you ll be hard pressed to find any that isn t logically equivalent when applied to values an analogous set of premises would be premise one some people believe that objectively speaking the shortest route from my house to a bar is through the main entrance of the estate and down the malahide road premise two i checked it out and found that the shortest route from my which is much closer you would never deduce from these that there is no shortest route from my house to a bar yet that is seemingly how you derive your relativist claim using premises which are logically no different no morals are a matter of belief so far the people still believe that the shortest way is through the main entrance no agreement on belief here and in order to have an analogy you would have to show that there is a shortest way and that there is a method to convince everyone of that it is the shortest way indeed in other words your analogy works only when one assumes that your premises are right in the first place if not it is a fallacy and if this were an argument for objectivism you d be right it isn t though it s a demonstration that the argument you gave me is neither argument against objectivism nor argument for relativism your gimmick is to assume in the first place that values aren t real and to use this to prove that values aren t real in other words you beg the question against me frank o dwyer i m not hatching that odwyer sse ie from hens by evelyn conlon

if he she did you would probably consider it rape of course not i would think that would be great fun not having ever felt the joy and peace the christians speak of with a longing gaze this is not what i got when i believed i just tried to hide my fear of getting punished for something i never was sure of the bible is hopelessly confusing for someone who wants to know for sure god did not answer in the end i found i had been following a mass delusion a lie i can t believe in a being who refuses to give a slightest hint of her existence obviously there are many christians who have tried and do believe so i suggest they should honestly reconsider the reasons why they believe and analyse their position in fact it is amusing to note in this context that many fundamentalist publications tell us exactly the opposite one should not examine one s belief critically i ll tell you something i left out of my testimony i posted to this group two months ago a day after i finally found out my faith is over i decided to try just one more time the same cycle of emotional responses fired once again but this time the delusion lasted only a couple of hours i told my friend in a phone that it really works thank god just to think about it again when i hung up i had to admit that i had lied and fallen prey to the same illusion no one asks you to swallow everything in fact jesus warns against it but let me ask you a question do you beleive what you learn in history class or for that matter anything in school i mean it s just what other people have told you and you don t want to swallow what others say right i used to believe what i read in books when i was younger or what other people told me but i grew more and more skeptical the more i read i learned what it means to use reason as a student of chemistry i had to perform a qualitative analysis of a mixture of two organic compounds in the lab i hated experiments like this they are old fashioned and increase the student s workload considerably besides i had to do it twice since i failed in my first attempt however i think i ll never forget the lesson no matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown is x it may still be y it is very tempting to jump into conclusions take a leap of faith assure oneself ignore the data which is inconsistent but it can still be wrong i found out that i was after all using exactly the same mechanism to believe in god mental self assurance suspension of fear filtering of information in other words it was only me no god playing any part the life death and resurection of christ is documented historical fact oh and i had better believe this dan many ufo stories are much better documented than the resurrection of jesus the resurrection is documented quite haphazardly in the bible it seems the authors did not pay too much attention to which wild rumour to leave out besides the ends of the gospels probably contain later additions and insertions for instance the end of mark one six nine two zero is missing from many early texts says my bible jesus may have lived and died but he was probably misunderstood as much as anything else you learn how do you choose what to believe and what not to this is easy i believe that the world exists independent of my mind and that logic and reason can be used to interpret and analyse what i observe nothing else need to be taken

willing to die for what you believed a liar how do you know what my attitude was try reading your bible again i was willing to die for my faith those who do are usually remembered as heroes at least among those who believe dan do you think i m lying when i say i believed firmly for one five years it seems it is very difficult to admit that someone who has really believed does not do so anymore

 from mcelwre cnsvax uwec edu subject free energy technology organization university of wisconsin eau claire lines two four eight important info it is humbly suggested by robert s fans that you redirect all followups into alt fan robert mcelwaine or at least consider doing so free energy technology by robert e mcelwaine physicist ninety to a hundred years ago everybody knew that a heavier than air machine could not possibly fly it would violate the laws of physics all of the experts and authorities said so for example simon newcomb declared in one nine zero one the demonstration that no possible combination of known substances known forms of machinery and known forms of force can be united in a practical machine by which man shall fly long distances through the air seems to the writer as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any physical fact to be fortunately a few smart people such as the wright brothers did not accept such pronouncements as the final word now we take airplanes for granted except when they crash today orthodox physicists and other scientists are saying similar things against several kinds of free energy technologies using negative terms such as pseudo science and perpetual motion and citing so called laws which assert that energy cannot be created or destroyed one st law of thermodynamics and there is always a decrease in useful energy two nd law of thermodynamics the physicists do not know how to do certain things so they arrogantly declare that those things cannot be done such principles of impotence are common in orthodox modern science and help to cover up inconsistencies and contradictions in orthodox modern theories free energy inventions are devices which can tap a seemingly unlimited supply of energy from the universe with out burning any kind of fuel making them the perfect solution to the world wide energy crisis and its associated pollution degradation and depletion of the environment most free energy devices probably do not create energy but rather tap into existing natural energy sources by various forms of induction unlike solar or wind devices they need little or no energy storage capacity because they can tap as much energy as needed when needed solar energy has the dis advantage that the sun is often blocked by clouds trees buildings or the earth itself or is reduced by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitudes and high latitudes likewise wind speed is widely variable and often non existent neither solar nor wind power are suitable to directly power cars and airplanes properly designed free energy devices do not have such limitations for example at least three u s patents three eight one one zero five eight three eight seven nine six two two and four one five one four three one have so far been awarded for motors that run exclusively on permanent magnets seemingly tapping into energy circulating through the earth s magnetic field the first two require a feedback network in order to be self running the third one as described in detail in science correct seven digit patent number required or try getting copies of both the article and the patents via your local public or university library s inter library loan dept a second type of free energy device such as the gray motor u s patent three eight nine zero five four eight the tesla coil and the motor of inventor joseph newman see science two one zero eight four pages five seven one two taps electro magnetic energy by induction from earth resonance about one two cycles per second plus harmonics they typically have a spark gap in the circuit which serves to synchronize the energy in the coils with the energy being tapped it is important that the total inductance and capacitance of the device combine to resonate at the same frequency as earth resonance in order to maximize the power output this output can also be increased by centering the spark gap at the neutral center of a strong u shaped permanent magnet in the case of a tesla coil slipping a toroid choke coil around the secondary coil will enhance output power earth energy fuelless propulsion and its very high torque makes it ideal for large trucks preventing their slowing down when climbing hills david mcclintock is also the real original inventor of the automatic transmission differential and four wheel drive crystals may someday be used to supply energy as shown in the star trek shows perhaps by inserting each one between metal capacitor plates and bombarding it with a beam of particles from a small radioactive source like that used in a common household smoke detector one other energy source should be mentioned here despite the fact that it does not fit the definition of free energy a bulgarian born american physicist named joseph maglich has invented and partially developed an atomic fusion reactor which he calls migma which uses non radioactive deuterium as a fuel available in nearly unlimited quantities from sea water does not produce radioactive waste can be converted directly into electricity with out energy wasting steam turbines and can be constructed small enough to power a house or large enough to power a city and unlike the tokamaks and laser fusion monstrosities that we read about migma works already producing at least three watts of power for every watt put in new times u s version six two six seven eight pages three two four zero and then there are the cold fusion experiments that have been in the news lately originally conducted by university of utah researchers b stanley pons and martin fleischmann some u s navy researchers at the china lake naval weapons center in california under the direction of chemist melvin miles finally took the trouble to collect the bubbles coming from such an apparatus had them analyzed with mass spectrometry techniques and found helium four which proves that atomic fusion did indeed take place and enough of it to explain the excess heat generated there are good indications that the two so called laws of thermodynamics are not so absolute for example the late physicist dewey b larson developed a comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe which he calls the reciprocal system which he describes in detail in several books such as nothing but motion one nine seven nine and the universe of motion one nine eight four in which the physical universe has two distinct halves the material half and an anti matter half with a continuous cycle of matter and energy passing between them with out the heat death predicted by thermodynamic laws his theory explains the universe much better than modern orthodox theories including phenomena that orthodox physicists and astronomers are still scratching their heads about and is self consistent in every way some free energy devices might be tapping into that energy flow seemingly converting low quality energy into high quality energy also certain religious organizations such as sant mat and eckankar teach their members that the physical universe is only the lowest of at least a dozen major levels of existence like parallel universes or analogous to tv channels as described in books like the path of the masters by dr julian johnson one nine three nine and eckankar the key to secret worlds by sri paul twitchell one nine six nine for example the next level up from the physical universe is commonly called the astral plane long time members of these groups have learned to soul travel into these higher worlds and report on conditions there it seems plausible that energy could flow down from these higher levels into the physical universe or be created at the boundary between them given the right configuration of matter to channel it this is supported by many successful laboratory controlled experiments in psycho kinesis throughout the world such as those described in the book psychic discoveries behind the iron curtain in terms of economics the market has failed inventors do not have enough money and other resources to fully develop and mass produce free energy equipment and the conventional energy producer have no desire to do so because of their ve ted intere t the government is needed to intervene if the government does not intervene then the total supply of energy resources from the earth will continue to decline and will soon run out prices for energy will increase and pollution and its harmful effects including the greenhouse effect acid rain smog radioactive contamination oil spills rape of the land by strip mining etc will continue to increase the government should subsidize research and development of free energy by inventors and universities subsidize private production until the producers can make it on their own and subsidize consumption by low income consumers of free energy hardware the long range effects of such government intervention would be wide spread and profound the quantity of energy demanded from conventional energy producer coal mining companie oil companie and countries electric utilitie etc would drop to near zero forcing their employees to seek work elsewhere energy resources coal uranium oil and gas would be left in the ground prices for conventional energy supplies would also drop to near zero while the price of free energy equipment would start out high but drop as supply increases as happened with vcr s personal computers etc costs of producing products that require large quantities of energy to produce would decrease along with their prices to consumers consumers would be able to realize the opportunity costs of paying electric utility bills or buying home heating fuel tourism would benefit and increase because travelers would not have to spend their money for gasoline for their cars government tax revenue from gasoline and other fuels would have to be obtained in some other way and energy could no longer be used as a motive or excuse for making war many conventional energy producer would go out of business but society as a whole and the earth s environment and ecosystems would benefit greatly it is the people that government should serve rather than the big corporation and bank for more information answers to your questions etc please consult my cited sources patents articles books un altered reproduction and

miss the rapture i stay calm and do not panic your natural reaction once you realize what has just occurred is to panic but to do so is absolutely useless now if you had wanted to get right with god before the rapture you could have but you chose to wait now your only chance is to stay on this earth and to endure to the end of the tribulation but he that shall endure unto the end the same shall be saved matthew two four one three ii realize you are now living during the great tribulation the great tribulation is a seven year period starting from the time of the rapture until christ s second coming also know as the time of jacob s israel s trouble jere three zero seven and daniel s seventieth week dan nine this period will be unparalleled in trouble and horror iii gather as many bibles as you can and hide them soon after the antichrist becomes the leader of the european community the revived roman empire bibles will be confiscated and owning a bible will be tantamount to treason the bible however will be your most valuable possession during the tribulation iv read the bible like you have never read it before in your life since all of your bibles may be confiscated even if you are careful it is imperative that you read the word until you memorize whole passages and can quote them it is especially important to read daniel luke two one matthew two four revelation and amos for these books describe the events you can expect to unfold before you v pray like you have never prayed before in your life pray until the power of god comes strongly upon you pray and pray and pray only by reading the word and praying will you gain the spiritual strength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the sake of christ vi do not take the mark at any cost even in fit means you and your loved ones die as martyrs after the antichrist becomes the leader of the european community he will institute a world economic system designed so that you cannot buy sell or eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name money will be useless and he causes all both small and great rich and poor free and slave to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name here is wisdom let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast for it is the number of a man his number is six six six revelation one three one six one eight the antichrist will implement the greatest slaughter in all of humanity think of the various ways people have been tortured and killed in the past such as the holocaust or maybe the crusades m you cannot even imagine the horror that will take place under the antichrist s rule it will be much worse than anything in history matt two four two one i saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held and a white robe was given to each of them and it was said to them that they should rest a little while longer until both the number of the fellow servants and their brethren who would be killed as they were was completed revelation six nine one one his targets will be jews and christians who do not worship his image or take the mark on their forehead or right hadn and i saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to jesus and for the word of god who had not worshiped the beast or his image and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on the hands revelation two zero four he will use every form of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce christ nor will he hesitate to use your loved ones against you even your children torturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take the mark if you take the mark or worship the antichrist or his image however you will be consigned to the second death which is the lake of fire sung about so eloquently by johnny cash m you cannot be redeemed it is better to endure torture for a short while and gain eternal life then sic to endure eternal torment in the ring h h h h lake of fire if anyone worships the beast and his image and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand he himself shall also drink the wine of the wrath of god which is poured out full strength into the cup of his indignation an sic he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the lamb revelation one four nine one zero and probably in the presence of season ticket holders special hats given to the first five zero zero zero at the stadium m vii set a plan in motion for survival although you may not be able to hide from the antichrist s government until the end of the tribulation all of the time you gain in hiding is important for your spiritual growth and strengthening since only those who are extremely strong in christ can suffer and die for his sake the first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or mountainous area for the antichrist s control will come last to the least populated areas take a good radio or tv with you so that you can stay attuned to events and discern the time schedule of the tribulation as you can see on the weather map heavy currents of tribulation will sweep into our area by daybreak expect delays on i nine five outbound and perhaps school closings m store water and food because you will not be able to purchase anything without the mark water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste from nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood get a good water filter m bring different types of clothing for all seasons as well as flashlights batteries generators and first aid supplies in short learn how to survive and live off the land as the pioneers did viii trust no one there will be secret agents everywhere spying for the antichrist s government be on the lookout perot supporters take note m ix watch for the antichrist it is important to realize who the antichrist is and what he is up to for he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will bring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it we can infer from daniel one one certain characteristics of this man popular during the first three and a half years of the tribulation he will dominate the airwaves he will be physically appealing highly intelligent with christ like charisma and personality an international politician military tactician and economic expert his word will be peace he will make a treaty with the jews which he will break after three and a half years he will have such supernatural power that a mortal wound to his head will be healed even the very elect will be deceived if you do not pray and read the bible you too will be deceived dominate the airwaves perhaps howard stern or rush limbaugh m the antichrist will have a companion the false prohphet sic who will make an image in the likeness of the antichrist and cause it to speak all who refuse to worhsip sic the image will be killed the final three and a half years will be absolutely insane with demonized spirits everywhere x do not give up hope the seven years of tribulation will end with the triumphant return of christ the antichrist will be defeated be steadfast and endure and you will be rewarded greatly in heaven start reading the bible and praying fervently now the salvation of your sould depends upon it determine that come what may you will not take the mark or worship the antichrist you still have a chance to be saved or remain saved but this time you will have to be faithful unto death may god find you ready in the hour of his glorious return mike cluff christianity

simon clippingdale writes i write imagine that one zero zero zero zero zero zero alterian dollars turn up in your bank account every month suppose further that this money is being paid to you by a your big hearted alterian benefactor or b a bug in an alterian atm let s suppose that this is a true dichotomy so p a p b one trouble is alterius is in a different universe so that no observations of alterius are possible except for the banks you couldn t possibly afford it now let s examine the case for a there is no evidence whatsoever that there is any such thing as a big hearted alterian benefactor however p exists b h a b p not exists b h a b one on the grounds that lack of evidence for is evidence against when we have a partition like that we dismiss hypothesis a turning therefore to b we also find no evidence to support that hypothesis on the same grounds as before we dismiss hypothesis b the problem with this is that we have dismissed all of the possible hypotheses and even though we know by construction that the money arrives every month we have proven that it can t because we have dismissed all of its potential causes that s an extremely poor argument and here s why premise one this money is being paid to you by either a your big hearted alterian benefactor or b a bug in an alterian atm thus each monthly appearance of the bucks should it happen is an observation on alterius and by construction is evidence for the existence of either the benefactor or the bug in the atm premise two no observations on alterius are possible except for the banks you couldn t possibly afford it you forgot to include this my premise is actually premise two the cardinality of the set of possible observations on alterius is one this is clearly contradictory to the first not if you state it properly trouble is on the basis of premise two you say that there can be no evidence of either the benefactor or the bug but the first premise leads to the conclusion that the appearance of the bucks should it happen is evidence for the existence of either the benefactor or the bug voila a screaming contradiction with my highlights sc but in a strawman argument there is only evidence for oneof benefactor bug no observation to distinguish benefactor from bug is possible that is not evidence for bug and neither is it evidence for benefactor nor is true to say that this hypothetical universe appears exactly as if there were no benefactor bug two statements both would be false this is still contradictory it reduces to one alterian dosh arriving in my account is due to benefactor or bug two this is not evidence for benefactor neither is it evidence for bug meaning that it doesn t lend more weight to one than to the other three therefore no evidence can exist for benefactor and no evidence can exist for bug but three relies on a shift in meaning from two when you say paraphrased in two that this is not evidence for benefactor for example what you mean is that it s no more evidence for benefactor than it is for bug yes that s what i mean in three however you ve shifted the meaning of evidence for benefactor so that it now means absolute evidence for benefactor rather than relative evidence for benefactor w r t bug not really i meant evidence that would tend to one over the other i think this is just a communications problem what i am trying to say in my clumsy way is that while i buy your theory as far as it relates to theism making predictions prayer your rapture example i don t buy your use of occam s razor in all cases where a zero in my example one couldn t dismiss benefactor or bug on the grounds of simplicity one of these is necessary to explain the dosh i brought up the one by one dismissal process to show that it would be wrong to do so from what you re saying in this post it seems you agree and we re talking at cross purposes three is still in contradiction to one some sums may help with b benefactor b bug d dosh arrives in account one implies p b b d one assuming that p bb d zero so it s either the benefactor or a bug which is responsible if the bucks arrive but not both then p b b d p b d p b d so p b d p b d one but three implies that p b d zero and p b d zero no this isn t what i meant p b d zero five and p b d zero five with necessarily no new observation we ve already seen the dosh to change those estimates i was trying to say again in my clumsy way that it would be wrong to assign zero probability to either of these and that s precisely what use of the razor does in the case of gods gods are one class of hypothesis there are many others belonging to a set of hypotheses one of which is necessary to explain something which otherwise would not be satisfactorily explained it can be thrown out or retained on grounds of non rational preference not of science or statistics alternatively one could chuck out or retain the lot on the grounds that the answer can t be known or that the notional probability estimates are effectively useless being equal agnosticism weak atheism as they do when the set m is filled by the universe is caused by x where x is gods pink unicorns nothing etc and no observation tends to one conclusion over the other exactly the point i was making i think so we don t throw out any of these contrary to your assertion above that we do some people do simon and they think they are doing excellent science my sole point was that they aren t only observations which directly contradict the hypothesis hi i e x where p x hi zero can cause p hi to go to zero after a finite number of observations only in this case do we get to throw any of the hypotheses out exactly my point though i may have been unclear you said the diametric opposite which i guess is the source of my confusion i was merely trying to illustrate the incorrectness of doing so what i m trying to say is that while you are correct to say that absence of evidence can sometimes be evidence of absence this does not hold true for all or perhaps any versions of theism and it isn t true that those for which it does not hold can be discarded using the razor on the contrary those for which it does not hold are exactly those which can be discarded using the razor see my post on the other branch of this thread then you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of if the razor holds for gods then it holds for all like hypotheses which means that you re assigning p x hi zero for all i though we ve already established that it s not correct to do so when sum p x hi one over all i simply put anyone who claims to have a viable proof of the existence or non existence of gods whether inductive or no is at best mistaken and at worst barking mad luckily i make no such claim and have specifically said as much on numerous occasions you wouldn t be constructing a strawman here would you frank although that doesn t of course rule out my being barking mad in any case i could be barking mad in my spare time with apologies to cleese et al but i think you miss the point once again when i say that something is evidence against an hypothesis that doesn t imply that observation of the said something necessarily falsifies the hypothesis reducing the estimate of p h data to zero if it reduces this quantity it s still evidence against h no i got that i m talking about the case when a zero you re clearly correct when a zero and i m not constructing a strawman though it s certainly possible that i ve misunderstood what you re saying however by any standards a system that says when a zero gods are highly unlikely and when a zero gods can be dismissed using the razor is a system purporting to be an inductive proof that gods either don t exist or are unnecessary to explain any or all phenomena in my experience systems such as this including those which purport to prove that gods exist always contain a fallacy upon close examination if that s not what you re saying then

 from acooper mac cc macalstr edu turin turambar me department of utter misery subject re faith and dogma organization macalester college lines one two three in article tgk cs toronto edu todd kelley writes in light of what happened in waco i need to get something of my chest sadly understandable faith and dogma are dangerous yes religion inherently encourages the implementation of faith and dogma and for that reason i scorn religion to be fair you should really qualify this as semitic western religions but you basically go ahead and do this later on anyway i have expressed this notion in the past some christians debated with me whether christianity leaves any room for reasoning i claimed rationality is quelled out of christianity by faith and dogma again this should really be evaluated at a personal level for example there was only one jesus presumably and he probably didn t say all that many things and yet seemingly billions and billions of christian sects have arisen perhaps there is one that is totally dedicated to rationalism and believes in christ as in pantheism it would seem to go against the bible but it is amazing what people come up with under the guise of personal interpretation a philosopher cannot be a christian because a philosopher can change his mind whereas a christian cannot due to the nature of faith and dogma present in any religion this is a good point we have here the quintessential christian he sets up a system of values beliefs for himself which work very well and every event experience is understandable and deablable within the framework of this system however we also have an individual who has the inability at least not without some difficulty to change which is important because the problem with such a system is the same as with any system one cannot be open minded to the point of testing hypotheses against the basic premise of the system without destroying whatever faith is invested therein unless of course all the tests fail in other words the fairer way would be to test and evaluate moralities without the bias responsibility of losing retaining a system i claimed that a christian philosopher is not a christian but is a person whose beliefs at the moment correspond with those of christianity consider that a person visiting or guarding a prison is not a prisoner unless you define a prisoner simply to be someone in a prison can we define a prisoner to be someone who at the moment is in a prison can we define a christian to be someone who at the moment has christian beliefs no because if a person is free to go he is not a prisoner similarly if a person is not constrained by faith and dogma he is not a christian interesting but again when it seems to basically boil down to individual nuances although not always i will admit and probably it is the mass oriented divisions which are the most appalling it becomes irrelevant unfortunately i admit it s a word game i m going by the dictionary definition of religion religion n one concern over what exists beyond the visible world differentiated from philosophy in that it operates through faith or intuition rather than reason webster s now let s go beyond the word game i don t claim that religion causes genocide i think that if all humans were atheist there would still be genocide there will always be humans who don t think there will always be humans who don t ask themselves what is the real difference between themselves and people with different colored skin or a different language or different beliefs granted religion is like the gun that doesn t kill anybody religion encourages faith and dogma and although it doesn t directly condemn people it encourages the use of just because thinking it is just because thinking that kills people in which case the people become the bullets and the religion as the gun merely offers them a way to more adequately do some harm with themselves if i may be so bold as to extend your similie sure religion has many good qualities it encourages benevolence and philanthropy ok so take out only the bad things like faith dogma and tradition put in the good things like careful reasoning and science the result is secular humanism wouldn t it be nice if everyone were a secular humanist to please the supernaturalists you might even leave god in there but the secular emphasis would cause the supernaturalists to start thinking and they too would realize that a belief in a god really doesn t put anyone further ahead in understanding the universe ok i m just poking fun at the supernaturalists also understandable of course not all humans are capable of thought and we d still have genocide and maybe even some mass suicide but not as much i m willing to bet on that todd todd kelley tgk cs toronto

 from mathew subject re death penalty gulf war long organization mantis consultants cambridge uk x newsreader rusnews v one zero two lines one five eight jbrown batman bmd trw com writes i don t regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made which affect the lives of innocent people but i do regret the circumstances which make those decisions necessary and i regret the suffering caused by those decisions i m afraid i m going to have to kill you don t worry though as a loving christian i guarantee that i will regret the fact that i have to kill you although i won t regret the actual killing if we hadn t intervened allowing hussein to keep kuwait then it would have been appeasement right but did you ever hear anyone advocate such a course of action or are you just setting up a strawman i m not setting up a strawman at all if you want to argue against the war then the only logical alternative was to allow hussein to keep kuwait false dichotomy diplomatic alternatives including sanctions were ineffective that s because they weren t even attempted but what about those who didn t support hitler s dreams of conquest it s not as if they democratically voted for all his policies the nsdap got four three in the elections of one nine three three and that was the last chance the german people got to vote on the matter they suffered along with the rest why does this bother you so much you want to know why it bothers me that thousands of innocent people were maimed or killed by bombing at the end of ww two when it was far from clear that such bombing was necessary the world is full of evil and circumstances are not perfect many innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others it it regretable but that s the way it is and why is it that way who set things up to be that way this was happening before the gulf war why didn t we send in the bombers to east timor why aren t we sending in the bombers now probably because we re not the saviors of the world we can t police each and every country that decides to self destruct or invade another no just the ones that have oil or the ones that look like they might make a success of communism nor are we in a strategic position to get relief to tibet east timor or some other places i don t see that getting un forces to east timor is any harder than getting them to iraq tibetan people are rounded up tortured and executed amnesty international recently reported that torture is still widespread in china why aren t we stopping them in fact why are we actively sucking up to them by trading freely with them tell me how we could stop them and i ll support it i for one do not agree with the present us policy of sucking up to them as you put it i agree that it is deplorable fine write to your congressman and to president clinton china s status as most favoured nation comes up for renewal in june point out that the us shouldn t be offering favourable trading terms to such a despicable regime i doubt anything will happen clinton s keener on trade sanctions against europe unbelievable comments about the rodney king case deleted the media is not totally monolithic even though there is a prevailing liberal bias programs such as the macneil lehrer news hour try to give a balanced and fair reporting of the news there are even conservative sources out there if you know where to look hurrah for rush any idea how many kill files you just ended up in i an atheist am arguing against killing innocent people you a supposed christian are arguing that it s ok to kill innocent people so long as you get some guilty ones as well hardly i didn t say that it s a good thing tm to kill innocent people if the end is just unfortunately we don t live in a perfect world and there are no perfect solutions if one is going to resist tyranny then innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die i didn t say it is ok it is unfortunate but sometimes necessary the ends justify the means eh you having criticised moral relativism in the past are now arguing that i am in no position to judge the morality of allied actions at the end of the war you certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist the same tired old misunderstanding moral relativism means that there is no objective standard of morality it doesn t mean you can t judge other people s morals christ on a bike how many times have we tried to hammer that into your head where s your christian love where s your absolute morality oh how quick you are to discard them when it suits you as ivan stang would say jesus would puke one day i will stand before jesus and give account of every word and action even this discourse in this forum i understand the full ramifications of that and i am prepared to do so i don t believe that you can make the same claim obviously not as i am an atheist i don t think you d get on with jesus though he was a long haired lunatic peace nik was he not and btw the reason i brought up the blanket bombing in germany was because you were bemoaning the iraqi civilian casualties as being so deplorable yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing wasn t accurate enough to hit industrial military targets in a decisive way by any other method at that time but in the gulf war precision bombing was the norm so the point was why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted in spite of precision bombing when so many more civilians proportionately and quantitatively died under the blanket bombing in ww two right unfortunately for you it turned out that my opinions on the matter were entirely consistent in that i condemned the bombing of dresden too i think you re being a bit glib with your explanation of the blanket bombing policy too you make it sound as though we were aiming for military targets and could only get them by destroying civilian buildings next door as i understand it that is not the case we aimed deliberately at civilian targets in order to cause massive damage and inspire terror amongst the german people civilians suffer but less civilians suffered in this war than any other iany other in history oh come on with wars like the falklands fresh in people s minds that sort of propaganda isn t going to fool anyone the stories of hundreds of thousands of iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk yes bunk the us lost two three zero zero zero zero servicemen in ww two over four years and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting yes and what about the millions of casualties the russians suffered it s hardly surprising the us didn t lose many men in ww two given that you turned up late mathew

 from kempmp phoenix oulu fi petri pihko subject re consciousness part ii kev strikes back organization university of oulu finland x newsreader tin version one one pl nine lines two zero seven kevin anthoney kax cs nott ac uk wrote about my reply diplomatic it a society that is constantly on the verge of flaming usenet diplomacy is the best way to ensure the voice of reason gets through isn t it i realize i m fighting occam s razor in this argument so i ll try to explain why i feel a mind is necessary kevin unfortunately you are now delving into field i know too little about algorithms your reasoning as i see it is very much along the lines of roger penrose who claimed that mathematical insight cannot be algorithmic in his book the emperor s new mind concerning computers minds and the laws of physics however penrose s claim that he has mathematical insight or your similar claim that wavefunctions collapse only when we consciously take a look could be just illusions we are obviouslu taking very different viewpoints i try to ponder on the problem of consciousness from an evolutionary perspective realising that it might not be anything special but certainly useful thinking back of what i wrote do you think worms have minds or not they are able to experience pain at least they behave just like that yet it is conceivable that we might some day in the future perform a total synthesis of c elegans from the elements would such a worm have a mind firstly i m not impressed with the ability of algorithms they re great at solving problems once the method has been worked out but not at working out the method itself this is true to some extent however i do not think that our brains work like computers at all in fact there is substantial evidence skarda one nine eight five skarda freeman one nine eight seven that brains work more or less chaotically generating enough randomness for mental states to evolve our brains work much like genetic algorithm generators i suppose the trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered does this mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already pre programmed into our brains this is somewhat unlikely given that our brains ultimately are encoded in four six chromosomes worth of genetic material much of which isn t used indeed this is extremely unlikely given the vast impact of nurture on our mind and brain i suggest however that before trying to understand our consciousness as a collection of algorithms kevin take a look at the references i mentioned and think again i still think the best experts on the nature of a conscious mind are neurologists neuropsychologists and biologists but do not flame me for my opinions since they study beings that are conscious the reason i am repeating my advice is that this discussion cannot lead to anywhere if our backgrounds are too different and please do not bring qm into this discussion at all not all physicists are happy with the claim that our consciousness plays some special role in physics i would say it doesn t the other problem with algorithms is their instability not many algorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code yet people survive strokes without going completely haywire there are side effects but patients still seem remarkably stable also neurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate can an algorithm survive if i randomly corrupt various bits of it s code again brains are not computers don t forget this this does not mean they need something else to work they just work differently their primary purpose is perception and guidance of action self awareness and high intelligence are later appearances the next problem is the sticky question of what is colour replace colour with the sensation of your choice presumably the materialist viewpoint is that it s the product of some kind of chemical reaction the usual products of such a reaction are energy different chemicals is colour a mixture of these you are still expecting that we could find the idea of green in our brains somewhere perhaps in the form of some chemical this is not how i see it the sensation green is a certain time dependent pattern in the area v four of our visual cortex and it is distributed with the help of areas v one and v two to the rest of the brain indeed a firing pattern i have sometimes thought of our consciousness as a global free induction pattern of these local firing patterns but this is just idle speculation scientific american s september one nine nine two issue was a special issue on mind and brain have you already read it from cover to cover there are two articles on visual perception so you might be interested but again please note that subjective experiences cannot be observed from a third person perspective if we see nothing but neuronal activity we cannot go on to conclude that this is not the mind kalat one nine eight eight writes about numerous examples where electric stimulation of different areas of brain have led to various changes in the patients state of mind for instance a patient whose septal area was stimulated without his knowledge by remote control during a psychiatric interview was quickly cured of his depression and started discussing a plan to seduce his girlfriend stimulations in the temporal lobe have sometimes led to embarrassing situations when the patients have started flirting with the therapist in conclusion there is evidence that one brains are essentially necessary for subjective experiences brain damage is usually equivalent to some sort of mind damage two conscious processes involve substantial brain activity in various areas of brain when we think of colours our visual cortex is activated etc three consciousness is an afterthought we become conscious of our actions with a half a second delay and our brains are ahead of our conscious will by at least three five zero ms thus i think it is fruitful to turn the question why do i see colours around and ask what is this i that seems to be observing since it seems that our conscious mind is not the king of our brains if this is so a computer won t see colour because the chemistry is different does an algorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an equivalent that doesn t it shouldn t because the outputs of each algorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances so why do we see colour this depends on what is meant by seeing colours does a neural network that is capable of recognising handwritten numbers from zero to nine see the numbers if it is capable of sorting them if you are asking why does an animal who is conscious of itself as an observer have an evolutionary advantage over an animal who doesn t i have a good answer read my previous posting where i wrote why a sense of identity helps social animals to swap roles and act more morally so that they don t unconsciously kill each other with newly discovered weapons a bit extreme but this is the basic idea when early homo became more and more efficient in using tools a sense of identity and the concept of self had to evolve in line with this development indeed respect for others and conscious altruistic behaviour might be evolutionary advantages for social animals such as early humans if i remember correctly quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction with two processes acting on it the first process has been called unitary evolution or u is governed by schroedinger s equation and is well known the second process called various things such as collapse of the wavefunction or state vector reduction or r and is more mysterious it is usually said to occur when a measurement takes place although nobody seems to know precisely when that occurs when it does occur the effect of r is to abruptly change the wavefunction if minds are required for this does this mean that until human minds came to the scene wavefunctions never collapsed but remained in the superpositions for aeons my how powerful we are this has been discussed before and i think this topic is irrelevant since we do not agree that minds are necessary and neither do physicists anyway i m speculating that minds would be in part x there seems to be some link between consciousness and r in that we never see linear superpositions of anything although there are alternative explainations for this i ve no idea how a brain is supposed to access part x but since this is only speculation that won t matter too much my main point is that there might be a place for minds in physics i agree but not in the sense you apparently mean above physics needs sharp minds to solve many real problems i ll go back to my nice padded cell now if that s ok with you it s ok if you don t

 from rashid subject re yet more rushdie re islamic law nntp posting host four seven two five two four one eight six organization nh lines one two six in article davec silicon csci csusb edu dave choweller wrote in article rashid writes stuff deleted the point of my post was that rushdie was not being condemned solely for the words in his book although this was certainly a contributing factor it was the whole series of actions of rushdie and his publishers following the publication of the book and the initial media spotlight placed on the book that in large part led to the fatwa the kind of fatwa levelled against rushdie is not lightly placed and there are any number of anti islamic writers both within and outside the islamic world who have not had fatwas made against them here someone who adds fuel to an explosive situation might be charged with incitement to riot if people die in the rioting the charges against him might become even more serious how can rushdie be blamed for the deaths of people who are demonstrating against him the deaths should be blamed on the people who dealt with the demonstrations or on the demonstrators themselves if they were violent to what lengths will you go to justify this barbaric behaviour against rushdie once the rushdie situation exploded into the media the muslim voice on the matter of the book was effectively restricted to short video bytes showing the dramatic highlights of muslim demonstrations for every twenty or so newspaper magazine articles interviews etc supporting rushdie there would appear one muslim voice this person was usually selected based on how dramatic and incoherent he was not on his knowledge of islam or the situation at the time this approx twenty to one ratio continued throughout the escalation of the crisis with rushdie in the central spotlight as the man of the moment the valiant defender of everyman s right to free speech decoupled from responsibility as an aside it s interesting that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up some books defaming certain ethnic and religious groups continued to be banned here it was felt that they injured the sensibilities of these groups and presented a false image which could promote feelings of hate towards these groups for muslims this kind of double standard was annoying rushdie saw this spotlight as a golden opportunity to lash out at organized islam and he did so with admirable verbal skill the only kind of islam which rushdie finds palatable is what he calls a secular islam an islam separated from it s qur an it s prophet god its legislation and most importantly from any intrusion into any political arena fine rushdie made his views known the muslim s made their anger at his book known the scale of the whole affair erupted into global proportions it was by this time already a political situation affecting governments as well as individuals the situation was a serious one with far reaching political implications at the centre of this turmoil was rushdie throwing fuel on the fire engaged in a personal crusade that made him oblivious to any sense of caution now you may feel that the person in the centre of a worldwide storm such as this has no responsibility has no reason to exercise restraint of any kind has no obligation to perhaps step back momentarily out of the spotlight till matters calm down perhaps you even feel that he is justified in boldly defying the anger of all those who dare to take umbrage at his literary work no matter what insult they find within it perhaps you see him as a kind of secular heroic knight mounted on the his media steed doing battle with the dragon of islamic fundamentalism well khomeini saw him as a disingeneous author who grew up in a muslim atmosphere knew well what muslim s hold dear who wrote a book which mischievously uses certain literary conventions to slander insult and attack islam and its most notable personalities who when faced with a situation that became a worldwide crisis continued with his mischief in the world stage of the media who even after people were injured and killed because of the magnitude and emotion of the situation continued his mischief instead of having the good sense to desist khomeini saw the crisis as mischief making on a grand scale mischief making that grew in scale as the scale of the crisis enlarged the deaths of muslims around the world and rushdie s continued media mischief even after this was the triggering factor that seemed to decide khomeini on putting a stop to the mischief the person at the centre of all these events was rushdie he was the source of the continuing mischief all media support government support was just that support the source was rushdie and his publishers who were nothing short of ecstatic at the publicity and were very happy to see rushdie constantly in the media the islamic rulings that deal with people who engage in this kind of grand scale mischief making was applied to rushdie you re attempts at justification are not doing the image of islam any good i have made no attempts at justification only at explanation image is the chief concern of muslim apologists for islam and for rushdie if muslims willingly relegated themselves to becoming a sub culture within a larger secular culture such that the secular principles and laws had precedence over the laws of islam then i have no doubt that islam would then be thought to have a good image principally because it would by and large reflect the secular image a good image usually means be more like me your attempts at totally exonerating rushdie reflect exactly the attitude that resulted in the polarization brought about by the crisis in iran the situation was monitored for many months when rushdie kept adding fuel to the flames through the free worldwide voice that the media gave him the situation was monitored more seriously when even after many deaths occured worldwide rushdie still did not desist the fatwa was pronounced when behaving like a total jerk endangers lives and the jerk sees this and still insists on his right to behave like a total jerk he has the rug jerked out from under him if the muslims didn t make such a big fuss over the book like issuing death threats and killing publishers no one would have heard of it the fatwa came later much later if rushdie didn t

five in article frank d zero one two s six five eight uucp frank o dwyer writes theism is strongly correlated with irrational belief in absolutes irrational belief in absolutes is strongly correlated with fanatism deletion theism is correlated with fanaticism i have neither said that all fanatism is caused by theism nor that all theism leads to fanatism the point is theism increases the chance of becoming a fanatic one could of course argue that would be fanatics tend towards theism for example but i just have to loook at the times in history when theism was the dominant ideology to invalidate that conclusion that that is the basic mechanism behind it imo the influence of stalin or for that matter ayn rand invalidates your assumption that theism is the factor to be considered bogus i just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism the point is that theism is a factor gullibility blind obedience to authority lack of scepticism and so on are all more reliable indicators and the really dangerous people the sources of fanaticism are often none of these things they are cynical manipulators of the gullible who know precisely what they are doing that s a claim you have to support please note that especially in the field of theism the leaders believe what they say now some brands of theism and more precisely some theists do tend to fanaticism i grant you to tar all theists with this brush is bigotry not a reasoned argument and it reads to me like a warm up for censorship and restriction of religious freedom ever read animal farm that s a straw man and as usually in discussions with you one has to repeat it read what i have written above not every theism leads to fanatism and not all fanatism is caused by theism the point is there is a correlation and it comes from innate features of theism gullibility by the way is one of them and to say that i am going to forbid religion is another of your straw men interesting that you have nothing better to offer two define irrational belief e g is it rational to believe that reason is always useful irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason the latter has been discussed for a long time with charley wingate one point is that the beliefs violate reason often and another that a process that does not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable information well there is a glaring paradox here an argument that reason is useful based on reason would be circular and argument not based on reason would be irrational which is it that s bogus self reference is not circular and since the evaluation of usefulness is possible within rational systems it is allowed your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics and mathematics are therfore circular the first part of the second statement contains no information because you don t say what the beliefs are if the beliefs are strong theism and or strong atheism then your statement is not in general true the second part of your sentence is patently false counterexample an axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis but is assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is used to obtain it i ve been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions of god here an axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis what you say here is a an often refuted fallacy have a look at the discussion of the axiom of choice and further one can evaluate axioms in larger systems out of which they are usually derived i exist is derived if you want it that way further one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms what is it you are trying to say compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational i can t agree with this until you are specific which theism to say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which i suspect you do not have using the traditonal definition of gods personal supernatural entities with objective effects on this world usually connected to morals and or the way the world works the affinity to fanatism is easily seen it has to be true because i believe it is nothing more than a work hypothesis however the beliefs say they are more than a work hypothesis i don t understand this can you formalise your argument person a believes system b becuase it sounds so nice that does not make b true it is at best a work hypothesis however the content of b is that it is true and that it is more than a work hypothesis testing or evaluating evidence for or against it therefore dismissed because b already believed says it is wrong a waste of time not possible depending on the further contents of b amalekites idolaters protestants are to be killed this can have interesting effects answer the question what the absolute set of morals is people agree on like they would agree on a football being a football benedikt

university england lines three eight six sorry about the delay in responding due to conference paper deadline panic in article bobs thnext mit edu robert singleton writes in article simon dcs warwick ac uk simon clippingdale writes alarming amounts of agreement deleted i made my statement about ockums razor from my experiences in physics thanks for info in baysian statistics very interesting and i didn t know it before i follow your proof but i have one questions we have two hypotheses h and hg the latter is more complicated which by definition means p h p hg that complicated isn t in fact where p h p hg comes from it s more the other way around it s from p h p hg p hg where g is the complement of g and by axiom p anything zero so p hg zero so p h p hg in a sense hg is necessarily more complicated than h for any h and g so i may be splitting hairs but what i m trying to say is that irrespective of subjective impressions of how complicated something is p h p hg holds with equality if and only if p hg zero as you point out it s a very simple matter to show p x h p x hg p h x p hg x and thus h is to be preferd to hg now to say that h is as consistent with the data as hg is to say p x h p x hg can you elaborate some on this well p x a p x b means that x is as likely to be observed if a is operative as it is if b is operative this implies that observing x does not provide any useful information which might allow us to discriminate between the respective possibilities that a and b are operative the difference reduces to the difference between the unknown and unhelpful prior probabilities p a and p b p x a p x b p a x k p a and p b x k p b where k p x a p x p x b p x so a and b are equally consistent with the data in that observing x doesn t give any pointers as to which of a or b is operative in the particular case where a h and b hg however we know that their prior probabilities are ordered by p h p hg although we don t know the actual values and it s this which allows us to deploy the razor to throw out any such hg also in the real world it isn t as clear cut and dry it seems to me we can t always determine whether the equality p x h p x hg is true that s certainly true but the particular point here was whether or not a divine component actually underlies the prevalence of religion in addition to the memetic transmission component which even the religious implicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of spreading the word now it seems to me as i ve said that the observed variance in religious belief is well accounted for by the memetic transmission model but rather less well if one proposes a divine component in addition since i would expect the latter to conspire against wide variance and even mutual exclusion among beliefs thus my personal feeling is that p x hg isn t even equal to p x h in this case but is smaller h is memetic transmission g is divine component x is the variance among beliefs but i happily acknowledge that this is a subjective impression btw my beef with your baysian argument was not a mathematical one i checked most of your work and didn t find an error and you seem very careful so there probably isn t a math mistake i think the mistake is philosophical but just to make sure i understand you can please rephrase it in non technical terms i think this is a reasonable request i always try to look for ways of explaining physics to non physicist i m not a baysian statistician nor any type of statistician so this would be very helpful not that i m a statistician as such either but the idea is that both theism and atheism are compatible with all of the read my observations to date however theism of the type with which i am concerned also suggests that for instance prayer may be answered people may be miraculously healed both are in principle amenable to statistical verification and that god s may generally intervene in measurable ways this means that these regions of the space of possible observations which i loosely termed appearances of god s have some nonzero probability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic since there is only so much probability available for each hypothesis to scatter around over the observation space the probability which theism expends on making appearances of god s possible must come from somewhere else i e other possible observations all else being equal this means that an observation which isn t an appearance of god s must have a slightly higher probability under atheism than under theism the bayesian stuff implies that such observations must cause my running estimate for the probability of the atheistic hypothesis to increase with a corresponding decrease in my running estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis sorry if that s still a bit jargonesque but it s rather difficult to put it any other way since it does depend intimately on the properties of conditional probability densities and particularly that the total area under them is always unity an analogy may or may not be helpful say that hypothesis a is the coin is fair and that b is the coin is unfair two headed i ve used a and b to avoid confusion with hheads and ttails then p h a zero five total one p t a zero five p h b one total one p t b zero the observations are a string of heads with no tails this is compatible with both a fair coin a and a two headed coin b however the probability expended by a on making possible the appearance of tails even though they don t actually appear must come from somewhere else since the total must be unity and it comes in this case from the probability of the appearance of heads say our running estimates at time n one are en one a and en one b the observation xn at time n is another head xn h the estimates are modified according to p h a en a en one a en one a m p h and p h b en b en one b en one b two m p h now we don t know p h the actual prior probability of a head but the multiplier for e a is half that for e b this is true every time the coin is tossed and a head is observed thus whatever the initial values of the estimates after n heads we have n en a m e zero a and n en b two m e zero b and since ek a ek b one at any time k you can show that zero five constant observation of no evidence for gods if evidence for them is at all possible under the respective theisms constantly increases the notional estimated probability that they don t exist it s important to draw a distinction between theism that could be supported or not supported by evidence and theism that can t given a theism for which evidence is in principle not possible it doesn t make sense to say lack of evidence supports the contrary view quite so but this type of theism is what i might call the g in the hg in terms of our ockham s razor discussion and i d bin it on those grounds so it depends upon your conception of this god if it s a conception like zeus who happened to come down to earth to play quite frequently then i agree with you lack of evidence for this conception of god is evidence that it does not exist but if your conception of god is one that does not make falsifiable predictions see below on falsifiable predictions then i disagree lack of evidence does not support a disbelief the hypotheses don t have to be falsifiable and indeed in my model the theism isn t falsifiable i used the phrase should obverse given any specific x theism does not make the prediction p x ht zero that s why i used the word should theism makes no predictions about any specific event i can only say i believe that god did such and such after such and such happens or i believe god will do such and such but for any given x i can never a priori say p x ht zero i can not even say this for the set of all x or some x this is what don t like about your use of probability we also have no way of assigning these probabilities i hold science to positivistic criteria if someone cannot tell me how to measure even in principle p x h then probability is not applicable to hypothesis h such is the case when h ht theistic and ha atheistic for example p x ha p x ha p ha what is p ha how do i measure it you don t have to we don t need in the above analogy to know any prior probabilities to deduce that the updating multiplier for the fair coin hypothesis is less than unity and that the corresponding multiplier for the two headed coin hypothesis is greater than unity you don t need to know the initial values of the running estimates either it s clear that after a large number of observations p fair coin approaches zero and p two headed coin approaches unity all you need to know is whether p x ha is larger than p x ht for observed x and this follows from the assumptions that there are certain events rendered possible not necessary under ht which are not possible under ha and all else is equal baysian statistics relies upon a series of observations but what if the hypothesis isn t amenable to observation and even for statements that are amenable to observation some observations are not relevant a sequence of observations must be chosen with care i m curious to know what types of observations x one x two you have in mind concerning theism and atheism any observations you like it really doesn t matter nor affect the reasoning provided that there are some possible observations which would count as appearances of god s examples of this might be a demonstration of the efficacy of prayer or of the veracity of revelation but any statement about p x h for general x still counts as a prediction of h if the theism in question ht says that prayer may be answered or that miracles may happen see my interpretation quoted again above of what god exists means then this is a prediction p x ht zero for such x it s what distinguishes it from the atheist hypothesis ha which predicts that this stuff does not happen p x ha zero for such x theism does not make the claim that p x ht zero for such x or i should say that my theism doesn t maybe i was too quick to say we had a common language you said that by the existence of god you mean the notion that the deity described by the bible and by christians does interact with the universe as claimed by those agents i agreed with this however i must be careful here i believe this i m not making any claims maybe i should have changed does to can there is an important shift of emphasis but any way since i only have a belief i cannot conclude p x ht zero for such x ok we ll downgrade does interact to may interact which would actually be better since does interact implies a falsifiability which we both agree is misplaced i don t think my theism makes predictions maybe i m not understanding what you mean by prediction could you explain what you mean by this word i ll explain but bear in mind that this isn t central all i require of a theism is that it not make the prediction appearances of god s will never happen as does atheism before somebody points out that quantum mechanics doesn t make this prediction either the difference is that qm and atheism do not form a partition predictions include such statements as prayer is efficacious implying if you do the stats you will find that prayer is efficacious or prayer is not efficacious or verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled i don t think we have any problems of misunderstanding here persistent observation of this stuff not happening consistent with ht though it may be is more consistent with ha as explained in the bayesian stats post even if ht god exists is unfalsifiable that s no problem for my argument other than that you have to let the number of observations go to infinity to falsify it asymptotically btw i do not consider an argument that requires an infinite number of observations as valid or rather that part of the argument is not valid we as existing humans can never make an infinite number of measurments and any conclusion that reilies on this i don t accept as valid that s fine i don t claim that theism is false merely that the finite number of observations available to me so far suggest that it is and that as i continue to observe the suggestion looks better and better renormalization stuff deleted in the bayesian stats post i assumed that theism was indeed unfalsifiable in a finite number of observations here s the relevant quote the important assumption is that there are some observations which are compatible with the theist hypothesis and not with the atheist hypothesis and thus would falsify atheism these are what i called appearances of god s but this need not be taken too literally any observation which requires for its explanation that one or more gods exist will count all other observations are assumed to be compatible with both hypotheses this leaves theism as unfalsifiable and atheism as falsifiable in a single observation only by such appearances of god s here is my problem with this for something to be falsifiable it must make the prediction that x should not be seen if x is seen then the hypothesis has been falsified now atheism is a word in oposition to something theism a theism aserts a belief and an atheism aserts a disbelief so there are certain atheisms that are certainly falsifiable just as there are certain theisms that are falsifable e g if my theism asserts the world is only six zero zero zero years old and that god does not decieve then this has been falsified however the atheism that is in oposition to an unfalsifiable theism is also unfalsifiable i could be wrong on this statment contd i think you are an appearance of god s is sufficient to falsify atheism whereas in general the corresponding theism is unfalsifiable i ll think more about it until then here is a general question suppse x were unfalsifiable is not x also unfalsifiable no by way of a counterexample let x the coin is fair or more accurately so that not x makes sense the two sides of the coin are different this is unfalsifiable by tossing the coin even a string of heads is consistent with a fair coin and you have to go to an infinite number of tosses to falsify x in the limit its converse is falsifiable and is falsified when at least one head and at least one tail have appeared this is partly what s wrong with you baysian argument which requires observations x one xn to be made there are simply no such observations that have a truth value in relation to the statement god exists now by use of your symmetry argument i can understand why someone would say since the statement god does not exist makes no predictions i will choose not to believe it but none the less this would be founded on a type of faith or if you don t like the word faith insert belief for which there is no falsifiable evidence instead i ll assume you meant god exists up there at the highlight but by our agreed definition of exists the statement makes predictions as i said above although it isn t falsifiable in a finite number of observations actually i mean god does not exist makes no predictions oops sorry mea culpa the truth of this statment actually depends upon which god you are refering to but i can think of some conceptions of god for which it is true but once again i m open to the posibility that i could be wrong so give me some examples of predictions of the statment god does not exist here is one that i can think of if true then there would be no healing or miricles but this can in principle never be determined one way or the other there are cases in which people seem to recover and are healed without the help of a doctor and for no known reason these situations do in fact happen they are consistent with a theistic hypothesis but in no way support such a hypothesis we agree here they are not inconsistent with an atheistic hypothesis i can t think of one prediction from god does not exist that isn t of this type but i might be missing something the rapture will not happen on october two eight one nine nine two said rapture would have falsified atheism to my satisfaction had it happened although its failure to happen does not of course falsify any theisms other than those which specifically predicted it no phenomenon which requires the existence of one or more gods for its

to think i m doing so since this is now dated however don t feel compelled to respond in article strom watson ibm com rob strom writes i was making two separate points both of which attack face value bible interpretation one to judge the bible s value today you judge it based on the way it is used today that is what do commentators actually say what do rabbis teach etc i suspect you meant this in context of the jewish tradition you have been referring to one problem with a highly interpreted tradition like this is what happens when a schism occurs and over time certain large and influential branches of the heretical group come to favor exactly a face value interpretation two to judge the bible s value when originally written you a read it in the context of its time not with today s assumptions and b compare it to the practices of surrounding people while the context of the time is important value judgments must ultimately be according to current understanding or at least to some base standard relative stability success of a society e g this is obviously true in comparing it to practices of surrounding people for instance according to the bible the surrounding people were immoral savages with repulsive and inhuman habits we need to look rather at what those peoples were really like for instance in what way is it better to worship a single god whose presence is symbolically strongest in a tent or temple over multiple gods some of whose presence is symbolically represented in a statue by the bible s own terms idolatry is inherently evil but i see no evidence that the followers of the various other religions of the area and time were particularly bad people relative to the people in the bible scissors and cloth now in the past our ancestors did cut cloth with scissors but they at least knew that their inhumane neighbors cut it with their bare teeth so this was a relatively enlightened step forward from their earlier barbarism and made the transition to modern civilized paper cutting that much easier sounds good but it presupposes teeth rending neighbors which i see no support for one can argue that post facto assertion of inhumane neighbors can be used to make moral points but that doesn t mean that the actual neighbors really were inhuman more to the point such dehumanization of the people across the river or over the mountain or even of a different people dwelling among us is all too common that complex and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic interpretations of that history is interesting but i still don t think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it to attack condemnation of the original history note that i m speaking of historical interpretation here for instance claiming that hammurabi s an eye for an eye was primitive brutal retribution while moses version was an enlightened benign fine because the tradition has since interpreted the phrase that way as of three zero zero zero years ago or so they probably both meant the same thing to be sure i m arguing from a parochial perspective i belong to this tiny tribe which has struggled against overwhelming odds for survival as a distinct tribe and this book is the book of my tribe the book commands us to dedicate ourselves to study to improve the world and to set an example as a light to the nations we ve revered the book and i think we ve been successful as scientists as artists and musicians as leaders in important humanitarian causes it s hard for me to separate the success of my people from the virtue of our book you d have to argue that we d have done significantly better with a different book or with no book or that another tribe with a different book or with no book has done significantly better i don t belittle the accomplishments particularly the intellectual ones of the jewish people i have given up on trying to think by analogy since i don t know of any other tribe that is at all similar the closest i can think of are the romany but i don t know enough about them to make a meaningful comparison i think a tradition of reflective study of flexible rather than dogmatic interpretation is a good thing i think that with such an attitude a case could be made that you could have done as well starting with a one nine four three captain america comic or whatever the

 from rashid subject re yet more rushdie re islamic law nntp posting host nstlm six six organization nh lines two three one in article darice yoyo cc monash edu au fred rice wrote stuff deleted now i do not believe in blindly following anyone no matter how knowledgeable he or she may be in islamic law if someone tells me islam says such and such i immediately say show me the support for this statement from the qur an and sunnah i believe this to be my islamic duty for according to one hadith of the prophet peace and blessings of god be with him if your leader tells you to enter a fire and you do it and kill yourself then you have sinned for doing wrong even though you were blindly following the instructions of your leader i am responsible for my own actions not abu hanifa or imam malik etc even if i am blindly following the opinions of abu hanifa etc with this in mind to my understanding we must look at the reasoning behind such opinions of muslims that support khomeini s fatwa now to my understanding the hadith upon which those who support khomeini s fatwa is relating to a particular instance that occurred during war time now brother in general it is imho ridiculous and wrong to say that a hadith relating to the actions of war is usable during times of peace i think any sensible human being can see this so i personally think that the reasoning of some of our ulema in this matter is faulty for they think it is legitimate to use acts of war in times of peace regarding this particular subject if you think i am wrong please feel free to say so with your reasoning from qur an and hadith please not because somebody said so i want the reasoning from al qur an and the sahih hadiths perhaps we should take our discussion to soc religion islam please email me rashid if you think we should do this by the way i also disagree with your opinion regarding the punishment for apostasy the viewpoint i follow that there is in general no punishment for apostasy is very strongly supported by qur an and hadith this is very well shown in the book punishment in islamic law by mohamed s el awa american trust publications one nine eight one i reiterate that i would agree with you that there is little justification for the punishment of apostasy in the qur an in islamic history as well apostasy has rarely been punished belief is considered a matter of conscience and since there is to be no compulsion in the matter of belief apostates have been generally left to believe or not believe as they will however when an apostate makes attacks upon god and his messenger the situation changes now the charge of apostasy may be complicated with other charges perhaps charges of sedition treason spying etc if the person makes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public attacks as opposed to arguement against islam the situation is likewise complicated if the person spreads slander or broadcasts falsehoods again the situation changes the punishments vary according to the situation the apostate is in anyhow the charge of aggravated apostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in rushdie s case there is a distinction in the qur an between a formal war situation and being in the situation where someone unilaterally wages war by their actions creates disorder makes mischief etc against the muslims and creates a situation that results in harm to muslims here a small group or even a single individual could be said to be engaged in such a practise in other words there is a clear difference between a formal war situation where two clearly defined parties wage war conclude treaties exchange prisoners etc and dealing with attacks that come from isolated individuals or groups against islam it is the second situation the unilateral attack and the spreading of fasad that would apply in the case of rushdie the matter of rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an offensive book banning the book is secondary a full set of circumstances following the publication of the book come into play as well including the deaths of many muslims and rushdie s and his publishers media games now i do not believe in blindly following anyone no matter how knowledgeable he or she may be in islamic law if someone tells me islam says such and such i immediately say show me the support for this statement from the qur an and sunnah i believe this to be my islamic duty for according to one hadith of the prophet peace and blessings of god be with him if your leader tells you to enter a fire and you do it and kill yourself then you have sinned for doing wrong even though you were blindly following the instructions of your leader i am responsible for my own actions not abu hanifa or imam malik etc even if i am blindly following the opinions of abu hanifa etc now to my understanding the hadith upon which those who support khomeini s fatwa is relating to a particular instance that occurred during war time now brother in general it is imho ridiculous and wrong to say that a hadith relating to the actions of war is usable during times of peace i think any sensible human being can see this so i personally think that the reasoning of some of our ulema in this matter is faulty for they think it is legitimate to use acts of war in times of peace regarding this particular subject i am not sure which hadith you are referring to above i believe that one of the qur anic verses on which the fatwa is based is five three three every verse in the qur an has a corresponding circumstance of revelation but in no way is the understanding the tafsir of the verse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance in which it was revealed if this was the case then we could say that all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the muslims were not involved in conflict should be suspended when they were at war the logic does not follow in complex real life situations there may be many verses and many hadiths which can all be related to a single complicated situation the internal relationships between these verses may be quite complex such that arriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and how each applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task it is not necessarily a simple this or that process there may be many parameters involved there may be a larger context in which a particular situation should be viewed all these matters impinge on the situation in other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the qur an the qur an asks us to reflect on its verses but this reflection must entail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith if the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety then each person has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that however if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to the state to the gestation of laws and rulings to the gestation of society the dispensing of justice the guidance of the community then there are certain minimum requirements of understanding that one should achieve jaffar ibn muhammad as sadiq a s relates some of these requirements as taught by the prophet s a in a hadith he who does not distinguish in the book of allah the abrogating verse from the abrogated one and a specific one from a general one and a decisive from an ambiguous and does not differentiate between a permission and an obligation and does not recognize a verse of meccan period from a medinite one and does not know the circumstances of revelation and does not understand the technical words of the qur an whether simple or compound and does not comprehend the knowledge of decree and measure and is ignorant of advancing and delaying in its verses and does not distinguish the clear from the deep nor the manifest from the esoteric nor the beginning from the termination and is unaware of the question and the answer the disjoining and the joining and the exceptions and the all inclusive and is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the subsequent one and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the detailed one the obligatory laws and the permissions the places of the duties and rules and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful and does not know the joined words and the words that are related to those coming before them or after them then such a man does not know the qur an nor is he among the people of the qur an based on these and other hadiths and in accordance with many qur anic verses why should not a company from every group remain behind to gain profound understanding tafaqquh in religion and to warn people when they return to them so that they may beware nine one two two a science of jurisprudence arose the requirements for a person to be considered a mujtahid one who can pronounce on matters of law and religion are many i ve listed a few major divisions below there are of course many subdivisions within these headings knowledge of arabic syntax conjugation roots semantics oratory knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir logic mantiq a knowledge of hadiths a knowledge of transmitters rijal knowledge of the principles of juriprudence qur an sunnah consensus reasoning the study of qur an and sunnah for purposes of law involves discussion of imperatives awamir discussion of negative imperatives nawahi discussion of generalities and particularities aam wa khas discussion of unconditional and conditional discussion of tacit meanings discussion of the abstract and the clear discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated the principles of application of the law involves principles of exemption principles of precaution principles of option principles of mastery the jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process in pronouncing judgement on a given situation it is not a matter of looking at one verse and one hadith now no one should blindly follow anyone but there is a difference between blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is clearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself there is the famous hadith of the prophet s a in which he says the fuqaha religious scholars are the trustees of the prophet as long as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires pleasures and wealth of this world the prophet s a was asked o messenger of god how may we know if they so concern themselves he s a replied by seeing whether they follow the ruling power if they do that fear for your religion and shun them i do not yet know enough about the imams of the four sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies to them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them the prophet also refered to the fuqaha as the fortress of islam my only point is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into play a certain amount of expertise the specifics of this expertise is delineated in the qur an and hadith those who acquire this expertise are praised in both the qur an and hadith those who without the requisite knowledge pronounce on matters that affect society state and religion are cautioned the only reason i said anything at all about the rushdie affair in this group is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa that is apostasy was wrong when one discusses something they should at least base their discussion on fact secondly khomeini was condemned as a heretic because he supposedly claimed to be infallible another instance of creating a straw man and then beating him perhaps we should take our discussion to soc religion islam please email me rashid if you think we should do this i agree that we should move the discussion to another newsgroup unfortunately i do not have any access to email so private discussion or a moderated group is out of the question i cannot post to a moderated group like soc religion islam how about soc culture arabic or talk religion misc as salaam a laikum

 from frank d zero one two s six five eight uucp frank o dwyer subject re theism and fanatism was islamic genocide organization siemens nixdorf ag lines three two three nntp posting host d zero one two s six five eight ap mchp sni de in article i three one five zero one zero one dbstu one rz tu bs de benedikt rosenau writes in article frank d zero one two s six five eight uucp frank o dwyer writes theism is strongly correlated with irrational belief in absolutes irrational belief in absolutes is strongly correlated with fanatism deletion theism is correlated with fanaticism i have neither said that all fanatism is caused by theism nor that all theism leads to fanatism the point is theism increases the chance of becoming a fanatic one could of course argue that would be fanatics tend towards theism for example but i just have to loook at the times in history when theism was the dominant ideology to invalidate that conclusion that that is the basic mechanism behind it imo the influence of stalin or for that matter ayn rand invalidates your assumption that theism is the factor to be considered bogus i just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism the point is that theism is a factor that s your claim now back it up i consider your argument as useful as the following belief is strongly correlated with fanaticism therefore belief is a factor in fanaticism true and utterly useless note this is any belief not belief in gods tiring to say the least i have backed it up read the first statement i have read it conspicuous by its absence is any evidence or point the latter is the fallacy of the wrong analogy saying someone believes something is hardly an information about the person at all saying someone is a theist holds much more information further the correlation between theists and fanatism is higher than that between belief at all and fanatism because of the special features of theistic belief truth by blatant assertion evidence gullibility blind obedience to authority lack of scepticism and so on are all more reliable indicators and the really dangerous people the sources of fanaticism are often none of these things they are cynical manipulators of the gullible who know precisely what they are doing that s a claim you have to support please note that especially in the field of theism the leaders believe what they say if you believe that you re incredibly naive you frank o dwyer are living in a dream world i wonder if there is any base of discussion left after such a statement as a matter of fact i think you are ignorant of human nature even when one starts with something one does not believe one gets easily fooled into actually believing what one says to give you the benefit of the doubt prove your statement the onus of proof is on you sunshine what makes you think that theist leaders believe what they say especially when they say one thing and do another or say one thing closely followed by its opposite the practice is not restricted to theism but it s there for anyone to see it s almost an epidemic in this country just for instance if it is harder for a camel to pass thru the eye of a needle why is the catholic church such a wealthy land owner why are there churches to the square inch in my country now some brands of theism and more precisely some theists do tend to fanaticism i grant you to tar all theists with this brush is bigotry not a reasoned argument and it reads to me like a warm up for censorship and restriction of religious freedom ever read animal farm that s a straw man and as usually in discussions with you one has to repeat it read what i have written above not every theism leads to fanatism and not all fanatism is caused by theism the point is there is a correlation and it comes from innate features of theism no some of it comes from features which some theism has in common with some fanaticism your last statement simply isn t implied by what you say before because you re trying to sneak in innate features of all theism the word you re groping for is some bogus again not all theism as is is fanatic however the rest already gives backup for the statement about the correlation about fanatism and theism and further the specialty of other theistic beliefs allows them to switch to fanatism easily it takes just a nifty improvement in the theology truth by blatant assertion gullibility by the way is one of them no shit sherlock so why not talk about gullibility instead of theism since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have as opposed to the case you are trying to make because there is more about theism that the attraction to gullible people causing the correlation and the whole discussion started that way by the statement that theism is meaningfully correlated to fanatism which you challenged indeed i did as i recall i asked for evidence what is the correlation of which you speak and to say that i am going to forbid religion is another of your straw men interesting that you have nothing better to offer i said it reads like a warm up to that that s because it s an irrational and bogus tirade and has no other use than creating a nice them us split in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either side of church walls blah blah blah i am quite well aware that giving everyone their rights protects me better from fanatics than the other way round of course other people are always fanatics never oneself your wish to slur all theists seems pretty fanatical to me it is quite nice to see that you are actually implying a connection between that argument and the rise of fanatism so far it is just another of your assertions so you can do it two define irrational belief e g is it rational to believe that reason is always useful irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason the latter has been discussed for a long time with charley wingate one point is that the beliefs violate reason often and another that a process that does not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable information well there is a glaring paradox here an argument that reason is useful based on reason would be circular and argument not based on reason would be irrational which is it that s bogus self reference is not circular and since the evaluation of usefulness is possible within rational systems it is allowed o k it s oval it s still begging the question however and though that certainly is allowed it s not rational and you claiming to be rational and all another of your assertions no proof no evidence just claims hey i learned it from you did i do good at the risk of repeating myself and hearing we had that before we didn t hear a refutation before so we re back deal with it you can t use reason to demonstrate that reason is useful someone who thinks reason is crap won t buy it you see that is unusually weak even for you the latter implies that my proof depends on their opinion somehow who does not accept that there are triangles won t accept pythagoras wow that s an incredible insight i don t have to prove them wrong in their opinion it is possible to show that their systems leave out useful information respectively claims unreliable or even absurd statements to be information totally circular and totally useless their wish to believe makes them believe things are judges by their appeal and not by their information it makes you feel good when you believe that may be good for them but it contains zillions of possible pitfalls from belief despite contrary evidence to the bogus proofs they attempt truth by blatant assertion i ve seen as many bogus proofs of the non existence of gods as i have of their existence rational systems by the way does not mean that every data has to come from logical analysis the point is that the evaluation of the data does not contradict logic it easily follows that such a system does not allows to evaluate if its rational in itself yes it is possible to evaluate that it is rational in a system that is not rational by the fallacies of that system but since the validity of the axioms is agreed upon that has as little impact as the possibility of a demon ala descartes this just doesn t parse sorry so far it just a matter of consistency i use ratiional arguments to show that my system is consistent or that theirs isn t the evaluation of the nor this predictions does not need rationality it does not contradict however your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics and mathematics are therfore circular anybody else think godel was silly stream of consciousness typing what is that supposed to mean the first part of the second statement contains no information because you don t say what the beliefs are if the beliefs are strong theism and or strong atheism then your statement is not in general true the second part of your sentence is patently false counterexample an axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis but is assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is used to obtain it i ve been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions of god here an axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis what you say here is a an often refuted fallacy have a look at the discussion of the axiom of choice and further one can evaluate axioms in larger systems out of which they are usually derived i exist is derived if you want it that way further one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms what is it you are trying to say that at some point people always wind up saying this datum is reliable for no particular reason at all example i am not dreaming nope there is evidence for it the trick is that the choice of an axiomatic basis of a system is difficult because the possibilities are interwoven one therefore chooses that with the least assumptions or with assumptions that are necessary to get information out of the system anyway i d like to see this alleged evidence one does not need to define axioms in order to define an evaluation method for usefulness the foundation is laid by how one feels at all that s not how one feels about it i see you have no irrational beliefs but then fanatics never do do they compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational i can t agree with this until you are specific which theism to say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which i suspect you do not have using the traditonal definition of gods personal supernatural entities with objective effects on this world usually connected to morals and or the way the world works imo any belief about such gods is necessarily irrational that does not mean that people who hold them are in principle opposed to the exercise of intelligence some atheists are also scientists for example they don t use theism when doing science or it wouldn t be science please note that subjective data lend themselves to a scientific treatment as well they just prohibit formulating them as objective statements ergo nothing is objective fair enough the affinity to fanatism is easily seen it has to be true because i believe it is nothing more than a work hypothesis however the beliefs say they are more than a work hypothesis i don t understand this can you formalise your argument person a believes system b becuase it sounds so nice that does not make b true it is at best a work hypothesis however the content of b is that it is true and that it is more than a work hypothesis testing or evaluating evidence for or against it therefore dismissed because b already believed says it is wrong a waste of time not possible depending on the further contents of b amalekites idolaters protestants are to be killed this can have interesting effects peculiar definition of interesting but sure now show that a belief in gods entails the further contents of which you speak why aren t my catholic neighbours out killing the protestants for example maybe they don t believe in it maybe it s the conjunction of b asserts b and jail kill dissenters that is important and the belief in gods is entirely irrelevant it certainly seems so to me but then i have no axe to grind here the example with your neighbours is a fallacy that your neighbours don t says little about others and there were times when exactly that happened nope it s not a fallacy it just doesn t go to the correlation you wish to see and tell me when it is not irrelevant why are such statements about amalekites and idolaters in the holy books please note that one could edit them out when they are not relevant anymore because gods don t err what does that say about that message excuse me the holy books and how come we had theists saying genocides ordered by god are ok a god is the easiest way to excuse anything and therefore highly attracting to fanatics not to mention the effect interpretation by these fanatics can have on the rest of the believers happens again and again and again a god is neither the easiest way to excuse anything nor the only way frank o dwyer i m not hatching that odwyer sse ie from hens by evelyn conlon

in article heiser acs two bu edu bill heiser writes in article chuck eos ncsu edu chuck kesler writes jeremy g mereness says can anyone offer any opinions of the ford probe ala how they do in the long run repair records reliability mileage etc i ve found mine nine three probe gt to do quite well window problem deleted artical has been trimmed i have had my probe looked at twice by my local dealer where i purchased the car the first time they made this problem worse the second time after advising them of the service bulletin mentioned on my ford probe mailing list they said they didn t know of the bulletin they adjusted the window and made it much better however it now makes a scritch scritch noise on rough roads and still squeals when i open close the window in wet weather anyone elses s do this i ve not had any of the air or leakage problems that have been reported but do get the squeal that bill describes i live in seattle so the wet weather may be a factor ford only gives one key with the car c mon ford spend an extra few pennies if i recall correctly i got two keys horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference you ve got to position the fingers perfectly to make it beep buttons are terrible this is true i m wondering if this may be a safety concern ie if people pound on the place where the airbag lives speaking of the horn i was surprised to find that the probe comes with one of those nice merican sounding horns instead of the japanese sounding kind the previous probes had japanese horns no opinion transmission the five speed is a must i have always been a five speed guy almost every car i ve ever owned has been a five speed because i got a good deal on this car with the two five zero zero miles i knowingly overlooked the fact that it has an automatic but it is a pretty high tech automatic it is a fully electronicaly controlled four speed with the five speed is much more fun we opted for the automatic for a number of reasons but it s still fun and in some ways more practical no shake rattle noises when going over bumps potholes still ditto shakes and rattles has been my main gripe i ve gotten them to fix the worst of them but i fear that with the rather harsh ride the car will be a virtual potpouri of rattles when it gets older i too would suspect that this may be true tires two two five five five vr one six goodyear eagles seven zero left hoping for three zero k very very very well it sticks to the road like glue even on a rough surface yes interior is very very nice too very pleasing to the eye and ergonomically sound definitely ford mazda did a very very nice job on this one the car has a much more expensive than it actually is look and feel to it ditto yes this car s stiff suspension isn t for everyone i personally like it but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car i d strongly suggest looking into the mx six agree check it out i don t mind it but would say that if it was much stiffer it might be a problem how about the nine three r one rx seven for suspension well i wouldn t encourage passenger carrying in the probe unless the person in the front seat likes to sit with his knees to the dash as mentioned in the consumer reports write ups consider the back seat as a parcel shelf no biggie to me though if it had been i d not have bought the car but it s definitely not a family car true i ve heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine i haven t heard about this one i know that some of the very early probes eight nine and maybe nine zero had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers which i ve had this problem and read about it or at least i assume the one i had was the one i read about in any case what happened was the weld between the muffler and the pipe feeding it ok so i m not a mechanic broke in my case the dealer welded it ordered replacement parts and put them on when they got them i suspect this is some sort of one design flaw or two production flaw in any case i have an earlier model and would expect it to be worked out on newer ones in any case it is a warrantee repair or they get the keys back from what i ve heard it sounds like ford mazda had some qc problems with the probe and probably mx six when they first went into production but i think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point that s almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this though i have to agree that they seem to have some qc problesm but i seriously feel the car design is sound and expect it to do very well i second this there seems to be some things that slipped through but the car seems very sound while not perfection what is you get an awful lot for your money bill heiser heiser acs bu edu heiser world std com

 from mcrosbie batman bmd trw com subject re viper car alarms lines eight two in article u one eight one five cs uiuc edu ronald e garnett writes hello auto enthusiasts i recently had more car mangled broken into and decided to get an alarm installed it s a viper four zero zero and has a shock sensor sensors for each door ignition cutoff and automatic door locks i have this same alarm installed in my syclone it works great the shock sensor is very sensitive but much more practical than the motion sensor i have on my other car it doesn t trigger if the car is rocked gently by the wind but any kind of shock sets it off even kicking the tire sets it off it works great what worries me is the hood and hatch if someone could pry them up gently enough then they could bypass the alarm the shock sensor is adjustable and there are two cycles on it you can adjust it to be sensitive enough that there is no way you could open the hood without setting off the alarm although i know that you cannot pop the hood on the syclone without setting off my alarm now and yet i have had zero none false alarms with this system the alarm tells you when you disarm it whether it has been activated in your absence i have been able to trace every alarm to it s cause and it was not a false alarm i m also wondering how easy it would be for a thief to crawl underneath the car and cut the battery cable to disable the alarm i guess it would be possible depending on the vehicle my syclone is so tight in the engine compartment that it would be tough to do this there are supplemental power supplies you can put on with this viper alarm but i don t have one i really think that if someone wants my car that bad the alarm won t keep them from it even with a supplemental power supply viper also sells some fancy field disturbance sensor that supposedly detects people approcahing the car this is primarily for convertibles i have a convertible and have looked at this feature in detail alpine actually makes a better radar unit if you want to get one of these it has zones in it that can be shut down independently so that if one side of your car has pedestrian traffic or something else that would trigger an alarm it shuts down the zone or rather pulls it in tighter i don t see the real benefit to these unless you have a convertible that you leave the top down on avoid the voice alarm that can be added to the radar package it talks to people as they walk by i saw one installed on a lotus esprit the kids would taunt it seeing how close they could get before it warned them to get back the owner finally disabled it which defeats the purpose in my mind i m interested in the opinions of you netters about these problems and about the viper in general i am real happy with my viper one other feature i really like is you can tune it to your preferences you can have it arm passively or not you can disable the chirp for arming disarming you can have it lock unlock the doors when the alarm is armed disarmed i like these features i hate the chirp when the alarm arms disarms so mine flashes the lights only i like the door lock feature although i have to be careful to take my keys with me because it doesn t know if you have left your keys in the car when it passively arms and locks the doors but if you are meticulous about taking your keys with you it takes care of the rest the car is an eight nine ford probe gt that used to be in great shape ron garnett i looked seriously at the alpine system too it is a real nice system but more money and it has a motion sensor standard instead of the shock sensor the shock sensor is better and the viper shock sensor is better two cycle than the optional alpine one imho i think the viper gives you a lot of good value for the money but it isn t absolutely tamperproof no system is except maybe the one that james bond had on his lotus in for your eyes only anyone know where we can get one of those installed maybe that was what they had in the van in the world trade center huh merrill

 from heiser acs two bu edu bill heiser subject re ford probe opinions centered around the gt organization boston university boston ma usa lines one five two in article chuck eos ncsu edu chuck kesler writes jeremy g mereness says can anyone offer any opinions of the ford probe ala how they do in the long run repair records reliability mileage etc some other owners on the ford probe world std com mailing list have commented about this problem but i haven t seen it happen on my three month old nine three probe gt i think this may be something that ford has corrected since the initial batch of cars also someone said that ford has issued a service bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem so you may be able to get your dealer to fix it i have had my probe looked at twice by my local dealer where i purchased the car the first time they made this problem worse the second time after advising them of the service bulletin mentioned on my ford probe mailing list they said they didn t know of the bulletin they adjusted the window and made it much better however it now makes a scritch scritch noise on rough roads and still squeals when i open close the window in wet weather anyone elses s do this ford only gives one key with the car c mon ford spend an extra few pennies i got two keys with my car but only one remote entry push button thingie but then i bought my nine three with two five zero zero miles and i think it may have been a repossession so i m not surprised something was missing horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference i am seriously considering following the advice in the owners manual where it describes the procedure to follow if you discover something on your ford that could cause serious injury threaten lives etc something about notifying the national traffic safety group as well as ford those little you ve got to position the fingers perfectly to make it beep buttons are terrible the latter is probably because of the air bag it s pretty much takes up all the space where you d expect to find the horn speaking of the horn i was surprised to find that the probe comes with one of those nice merican sounding horns instead of the japanese sounding kind the previous probes had japanese horns well i guess that s good in a way but in a way it s bad when someone hears that kind of horn they expect to see a big american car they may not associate the sound with a small jap car style car like the probe is tires fling dirt mud onto side of car yeah not very badly but enough to be annoying sometimes the mudflaps help a lot transmission the five speed is a must i have always been a five speed guy almost every car i ve ever owned has been a five speed because i got a good deal on this car with the two five zero zero miles i knowingly overlooked the fact that it has an automatic but it is a pretty high tech automatic it is a fully electronicaly controlled four speed with torque converter lockup even with the automatic i m getting three five mpg on the highway driving six five seven zero but of course driving six five is illegal so i probably made that sentence up around town the mileage has been around two five two seven not bad for an automatic of course it doesn t have the control of a five speed but since i do a lot of city driving it turns out to be very convenient it s nice to be able to drink a cup of coffee and drive at the same time although that too is illegal here in we like to control your life massachusetts no shake rattle noises when going over bumps potholes still shakes and rattles has been my main gripe i ve gotten them to fix the worst of them but i fear that with the rather harsh ride the car will be a virtual potpouri of rattles when it gets older tires two two five five five vr one six goodyear eagles seven zero left hoping for three zero k on my eight nine probe gl i got about four zero k out of the original goodyears and had driven the replacement tires bridgestone five zero k miles when i tradeed the car the one nine five six five six zero vr one four firestones on my nine three probe look like they re designed for performance ie rather wide shallow tread etc so they probably won t last as long but the car handles very very very well it sticks to the road like glue even on a rough surface interior is very very nice too very pleasing to the eye and ergonomically sound definitely ford mazda did a very very nice job on this one the car has a much more expensive than it actually is look and feel to it yes this car s stiff suspension isn t for everyone i personally like it but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car i d strongly suggest looking into the mx six having driven an eight nine probe for four years i find the nine three suspension interesting the car actually drives much better than the eight nine it is a very firm ride and you definitely know about each and every bump in the road yet the car remains very civilized on even the bumpiest roads you hear and feel the bumps yet the car retains its posture very well if you have three passengers by all means bring them along too they ll find that they have no room in the back and you ll find that the car rides differently if that s better is up to you well i wouldn t encourage passenger carrying in the probe unless the person in the front seat likes to sit with his knees to the dash as mentioned in the consumer reports write ups consider the back seat as a parcel shelf no biggie to me though if it had been i d not have bought the car but it s definitely not a family car also there s a lot of glass around you which i wasn t expecting the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer a c is a must on any probe from eight nine nine three the nine three in particular sends out a real blast of cool air when the ac is on max that lots of glass you mentioned is what gives the car the very good visibility reports you see in all the write ups most sports sporty cars don t have that good visibility i ve heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine i haven t heard about this one i know that some of the very early probes eight nine and maybe nine zero had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers which the complaints i ve heard re exhaust system on nine three s have been on the gt of course being a different engine that is a differeent exhaust system i was one of those with an eight nine who qualified for the free replacement since i had already replaced the muffler when i received the notice i was am due a refund from ford i applied in february and am still waiting gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that i was without my car i was quite happy with the way they handled especially considering that i was expecting the worst from them yes i was pretty amazed when i had my car in for some touch up adjustments this past week and they had to keep it overnight too busy for them to get to it and they offered to pay for a rental they did make me pay for taxes and insurance though from what i ve heard it sounds like ford mazda had some qc problems with the probe and probably mx six when they first went into production but i think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point that s almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this though i have to agree that they seem to have some qc problesm but i seriously feel the car design is sound and expect it to do very well bill heiser heiser acs bu edu heiser world std com boston university

 from kimgh mentor cc purdue edu gene kim subject review one nine eight nine ford taurus sho organization purdue university lines three three zero review of one nine eight nine ford taurus sho by gene kim background last week i bought a one nine eight nine ford taurus sho moving up from driving a one nine eight seven toyota celica st and a one nine seven five oldsmobile cutlass i have been interested in buying a sho for about five months and have been combing the classifieds in denver and chicago every week i bought a remarkably clean maroon red sho with nine two k miles on it for six eight zero zero as far as i can tell this is about two zero zero zero under blue book and i still have another eight zero zero zero miles before the extended service plan runs out as one should with any pre one nine nine one shos i made sure that the car was already refit with the upgraded clutch and pressure plate as well as having been recalled for upgraded rotors and seatbelt attachments however my sho does not have the newer rod shifter i understand i can get this for two three zero from any ford service center in addition the car received the full tune up at six zero k miles receiving new platinum plugs and valve adjustment for a car with nine two k miles on it the car was virtually immaculate the clearcoat paint job was devoid of any large chips or dents although the front air dam molding was covered with lots of small scratches not surprising since most of the miles were spent on the highway having driven a smaller two door coupe for so long i was a bit concerned about whether i could get used to driving a larger car to my surprise the size of the car doesn t bother me at all it seems just as nimble as my celica no comparisons with my oldsmobile visibility from the driver s seat is excellent helped mostly by of the small the quarter windows aft of the back seat door windows and in front of the c pillar and rear window parallel parking is a bit more difficult but other than that i love the size in fact i m starting to appreciate the large trunk as i pack up for a one four hour drive to washington dc for the summer more on the ride later in this review engine as with anyone even slightly interested in shos i was very interested in the two four valve three zero l yamaha shogun engine i was not disappointed base performance of the engine under four zero zero zero rpms is good you can even do reasonable launches from second gear although i don t make a practice of this the engine revs smoothly and eagerly tooling around town does not require many shifts this is good since the shifter is definitely one of the weakest points of the car more on this later while the performance of the engine under four zero zero zero rpms may be unremarkable it undergoes a jekyll hyde transformation once you hit higher revs at four five zero zero rpms a butterfly valve opens and you can literally hear and feel the geometry of the engine changing as twelve more valves open up the engine soars to its seven zero zero zero rpm redline and you are treated to in my opinion the sweetest sounding v six around the engine inexplicably sounds overjoyed to be at six five zero zero rpm i ve noticed that when i drive around town i constantly watch the tach to see how far below four zero zero zero rpm i am to go from two zero zero zero rpm to four zero zero zero you may have to punch the accelerator while torque is more than adequate it doesn t come fully online until those other one two valves are used transmission when car and driver first reviewed the car in one nine eight eight they marvelled at how ford had put such a wimpy clutch and balky shifter into the car i remember driving a friend s parent s sho in one nine nine zero and remember thinking about whether i had the leg strength to drive the car in traffic the clutch was that stiff that was back then the entire clutch assembly on my sho has been replaced under a ford recall in one nine nine one the clutch on the sho feels no stiffer than the one on my toyota celica in fact the friction point seems a bit larger and more forgiving when playing with the shifter with the car parked the shifter felt very reasonable the one two and three four gates were where you d expect it to be and the shifting action was smooth on the road it s much the same but you have to shift slowly make no mistake it s a clumsy shifter when hurrying shifts like when i was initially trying to impress friends i consistently miss the one two shift often grope clumsily for the two three shift and sometimes even muff the three four shift i find this pretty amazing in a car like this it also took me several days to realize that you get the smoothest shifts when you take your time seems obvious but compared to my toyota and my friend s honda this seems atrocious and clumsy someone on rec autos noted that crxs should blow shos off the line because of the incredibly clumsy shifter i now shift much more sedately and the shifter seems more reasonable when you play within these bounds the shifter works smoothly with no surprises i don t know whether the rod shifter upgrade would help at all along these same lines i initially had trouble shifting gears smoothly again slowing down the shifts and taking more care to match revs when letting out the clutch helped immensely this took several days for me to get the hang of i think some of my problems were because i ve never had a car with enough power to balk at bad shifts in higher gears occasionally i have trouble shifting into reverse the shifter refuses to enter the gate and i often grind the synchros trying to get it into gear i ll be watching this carefully in the next couple of months a quirk when i upshift and the engine drops back to one zero zero zero two five zero zero rpm i hear a whirring and then a grinding noise coming from the the engine compartment not terribly loud but the passenger can definitely hear it i asked about it when i was looking at the car as do all my passengers apparently this is a definitely a sho sound and is the gearbox apparently called gear rollover replies to my queries on rec autos are at the end of this review exterior as i mentioned before i am astounded by how well the body of this sho has stood up paint chipping on the front bumper and grille are virtually non existent looking at how older tauri sometimes don t age so gracefully i wonder what the guys at ford did differently to the sho bodies the body in my opinion is extremely attractive with matching color body moldings than the stock tauri for some odd reason the sho seems different enough from vanilla tauri to get stares at stoplights of course this could be my overactive imagination shos get fog lights a more open grille a completely monochromatic exterior and a deeper ground skirt in the back with sho stenciled in relief i ve seen a couple shos whose owners have colored these in with florescent colors or in black yuck i don t think the car is flashy i like it that way i feel almost anonymous with all those tauri out there but different and distinctive enough to those of us who care interior the interior is what really makes me feel like i don t deserve the car the seats are grey leather the steering wheel and shifter are covered with black leather and the entire instrument panel is done in a black grey metallic scheme the instrumentation is stock taurus except for the one four zero mph speedo and eight zero zero zero rpm tach you get a center console with two cupholders a large compartment under the radio great for a cd player an armrest that contains yet another compartment three appropriately sized coin holders for tollways i think and a compartment for holding cassette tapes there s map holders in the doors and an oddly small glove compartment i spilled a whole can of coke in the cupholder and was delighted to find that the entire rubber holder can be removed and washed in a sink hey i m really impressed with the ergonomics and thoughtfulness that went into its design and it s a one nine eight nine before the interior was upgraded the backseat is bigger than any car i ve had why do they need so much space no smart ass comments please the driver and passenger seat have lumbar and side bolsters from what i hear it s not uncommon for the side bolsters to show wear mine is no exception the left side bolster on the driver s has cracked and i m not convinced the right bolster is inflating all the way a big surprise for me i forgot that shos don t have a normal hand parking brake instead they have the regular parking brake that you press with your left foot too bad again i m getting used to it but it seems a bit anachronistic to me ride the suspension is nice and stiff too stiff it s stiffer than any car i ve had a friend s new one nine nine three toyota celica st seems tauter and is still able to soak up bumps better the sho seems stiffer with less ability to soak up bumps driving over railroad tracks is a noisy and jarring affair on the other hand taking turns feels wonderful because the body is so rigid and doesn t flex at all i listened for that before i bought the car on the highway the ride is great when i drove the car from chicago back to purdue i had trouble keeping under eight five mph let alone from trying to see what one zero zero mph really feels like it s a relatively quiet ride but the sunroof rattles i ve tried to find out what exactly makes all the noise up there but it seems to be the window that rests on the rails no easy way to get rid of it i think over the past three days i ve oscillated between thinking the suspension is wonderful and perfect and thinking that the ride is way too rough not for me mind you but i wonder whether i would advise my dad to buy one for himself but i ve discovered as with the shifter if you take your time with shifts you ll have no reason to complain let me explain the ride is worst when turning and applying lots of power to the wheels i feel the wheels scrabbling for traction and torque steer making the car skitter left and right after i understood this i avoid the limits of traction and i m a happy camper again it s not body rigidity but the composure of the car as if matching the suspension the steering feel is quite heavy my first impression of driving my sho was how hard you had to turn the wheel at highway speeds it tracks straight as an arrow but when driving around a parking lot the high effort steering didn t seem so useful however it s reasonable but it doesn t communicate the road to the driver as well as a one nine nine three ford probe gt imho it s much better than the steering on my celica st i wonder how bad this car is during winter miscellaneous notes gripes the rattles from the sunroof is intermittent some days it rattles loudly other days i look up wondering where all the noise went activating the sunroof is sometimes very noisy loud squealing as it retracts on its rails i wonder if there is a quick fix for this again other days it completely disappears function of humidity once i made the connection between the sometimes awful feeling suspension and torque steer i ve never complained about ride i wish the seats had more support under the thighs also i wish the side bolsters would close more tightly i hear that tires for this car can get really expensive i currently have goodyear gt four s that cost the previous owner five zero zero for four i used to hate the ford stereo systems whose idea was it to use a volume paddle now to my amazement i don t really mind and sometimes think it s an okay idea pretty ridiculous though getting up to four zero zero zero rpm sometimes seems to be a chore but this is no big deal there is more than enough torque down low i often goof up the shifting when driving with friends it took me a couple of days before i could really shift smoothly from two nd to three rd gear hard to believe isn t it my car has almost nine three zero zero zero miles on it my parents noted that it is almost impossible to find a low mileage sho astute observation imho i wonder how long i can make my sho last i just bought a book titled drive it forever for tips in this department the goofy parking brake pedal still throws me for a loop i once parked the car in gear and then accidentally let out the clutch after i started it the car jolted forward and bounced off the car in front of me no paint damage at all but starting the car is a whole new ritual for me with that fangled pedal also i began to wonder how strong that brake really is today i backed out of parking spot today and started to drive away before i noticed the glowing brake light oops the driver s power window creaks when closed all the way the same thing happens in my parents one nine eight nine mercury sable oddly all the other windows work smoothly likes i m liking the interior amenities more and more each day the cupholders are great i didn t expect to use the keyless entry buttons so much but it really is handy you can lock all the doors by pressing the seven eight and nine one zero buttons together neat and you can never lock yourself out of the car i really feel like i don t deserve this car i really can t believe that i could afford it i got this car ten years ahead of schedule i love this car so much that i ve been telling my parents to look into buying one i love this car so much that i wrote this one three k file i meant to write a couple of lines and ended up with this if there were a j d powers survey for used car owners i would have an opportunity to express my incredible satisfaction of owning this car i don t like thinking about getting another car but at this point in time i m sure i d buy another sho for under seven zero zero zero you can t beat it next time with an airbag and abs though insurance wise this car is also a big win i pay the same premiums as on my one nine eight seven toyota celica despite that it has nearly twice the horsepower other odds and ends much to my amazement there is no sho mailing list anywhere maybe because the sho registry publication has filled this void i haven t joined yet but i ve noticed that queries about shos still appear on rec autos about once a month owners of shos are always quick to respond and are very vocal fans of the cars maybe some of the most vocal on rec autos i ve put together the responses to my questions about the cars as well as other posts with useful information on these cars i ll be posting this in the form of a faq soon if anyone is interested in starting a mailing list please speak up i don t know if i have the resources here at purdue to start one but maybe someone out there does gene kim genek mentor cc

 from eliot engr washington edu eliot subject review audi s four quattro organization skulls r us lines one seven five distribution world reply to eliot engr washington edu eliot nntp posting host lanmola engr washington edu it s been a while since i ve reviewed a car but today i paid a visit to an old friend whose love for audis has been so overwhelming that he makes a not too sucessful living selling them without further delay i will get to the one nine nine three audi s four one servotronic steering for those who are not familiar with what servotronic is it is the name for the speed variable power steering manufactured by zf and used in audis and bmws i have been outspoken in my damming of servotronic over the past couple of months and this was based on magazine reviews and drives of the audi nine zero cs quattro and the audi one zero zero cs fwd i am quite happy to report now that on the s four the servotronic is inoffensive i suppose that due to the fat gumball tires the servotronic has been loaded up more and this so far has been the best implementation that i have tried it is far from perfect mind you and i d be much happier if it was an option that i could refuse but on the s four i no longer consider this to be bad enough where i feel the entire car is ruined the steering is still a tad too light but it is accurate and i suppose the stiffly sprung chassis sends back so much information that some makes it through to the driver s hands so there is feel and there is accuracy in the s four s steering but there is also room for improvement i consider the s four s steering to be better than the japanese competition primarily because the japanese do not believe in feel and engineer it out completely two engine wheee what a pressure cooker with just one one zero miles on the clock i did not expect the s four to be producing anywhere close to what it will be putting out one zero zero zero zero miles later but still the car packs a terrific punch for a turbocharged machine it is very unusual in that it encourages lazy driving i e low revs high gear it is so supremely flexible that one could hardly believe that there s only two two liters of displacement to move this three seven zero zero pound car around in such a fashion with maximum torque available at one nine five zero rpm and a seven two zero zero rpm redline the car can pretty much be left in third all day which translates to a speed range of something like two zero one zero zero mph a chracteristic that one normally associates with large capacity v eight s the technical achievement is breadthtaking throttle response is right up there with a good atmospheric engine in fact it would even put peaky multivalve engines to shame downshifts are almost unnecessary it is more fun to use the overboost feature than to rev the engine for those not familiar the s four engine features up to one five seconds of additional turbo boost for passing sort of like lighting up the after burners in a jet fighter one could with the right foot only in third gear blast the car from three zero to eight zero in just a few moments simply by flooring the gas as far as the numbers go maximum torque available in overboost mode shoots up to about two seven zero lb ft incredible for a two two liter it takes a few moments for it to develop overboost but it is well worth waiting for since this is quite a heavy car one s body parts are not flung around like say the corrado vr six the acceleration is smooth and strong somewhat similar to riding in a jetliner as it accelerates down the runway on takeoff also one is treated to a very distinctive and entertaining whistle from the turbo the only entertaining sound to come out of a very refined but bland sounding five banger yes audi has refined the five to the point where at seven two zero zero rpm it sounds as serene as it does at two zero zero zero the smoothness is outstanding but not quite up to the standards of a very good six e g a one two valve bmw i d say that in terms of refinement i e willingness to rev smoothness lack of harshness under full acceleration it is better than many v six s however lost in the refinement process is the characteristic five cylinder bark that made the older engines so characterful if not terribly refined the two zero valve turbo five sounds pretty bland except for the whistle under full boost subjectively i d rate the vw vr six engine as being far more musical than the turbo five also audi s own v eight is also far more musical with a rorty race car growl when pressed though none of these can match its grunt the only hint of the engine s true capacity occurs when one is taking off from rest after the turbo has come to a near stop with the extra inertia from the permanently engaged four wd system one has to be somewhat delicate in feeding in the clutch to prevent an embarassing stall alternately one could use more revs in both cases a very small price to pay for such a fantastic engine i think that audi of america should offer an automatic option for this car just as they offer though in extremely small numbers a five speed for the much peakier v eight the characteristics of the engine are perfect for an automatic ironically in europe a slush is available but none is offered for the land of the slush marketing twits rearing their ugly heads again three chassis i ve noticed that audis tend to have very wide wheels and relatively modest tire widths the car comes with firestones of size two two five five zero zr one six which is not uncommon at all however the very attractive five spoke wheels are no less than eight inches wide so there is no sidewall bulge whatsoever combined with the flared wheel arches the s four has a mouth watering macho yet subdued look on rough concrete it becomes immediately clear that the new one zero zero body style has made significant advances in structural rigidity as well as road noise suppression i suppose the two are inter related but i digress to use a cliche the s four s body feels like it has been carved out of stone flex is totally undetectable even when going over rough roads with a super rigid body like this stiff springs and stiff dampers do not cause excessive harshness and while the s four s ride quality will never worry a lexus it will also not draw comparisons to trucks or pony cars the servotronic steering has already been mentioned i consider it to be inoffensive because it did not inhibit spirited cornering i was able to test the car s cornering powers without too much trepidation i think a new concept is at work in this car with its fat gumball tires talking about understeer or oversteer is practically meaningless on a banked highway on ramp i went in slow and started applying power as i went around i could feel the g forces build to the point where the skin on my face was being tugged sideways yet the car was totally and completely obedient to throttle and steering inputs it felt that the limits were not even close to being approached the g forces were thrilling but the entire affair of going around a curve is strangely uninvolving you tell the car what you want and it does it end of story i think that i am starting to relate more and more to those reviewers who were highly impressed by the honda nsx s clinical efficiency but were unable to fall in love with the car the brakes have a very good firmness to them and stop the car pretty well too though i ve read that they are prone to fade i am not too surprised since the s four does not have uprated brakes over the base audi one zero zero fwd harder pads would help but that in turn would lead to a more wooden response when cold i am starting to see a trend among the luxury sports sedan makers where extra weight is not being offset by additional braking capacity the ls four zero zero s fade performance is nothing to brag about neither is the q four five s or the legend s brake fade these days seem to be a forgotten virtue when everybody s attention is focused on anti lock capability four comfort for a car with such sporty abilities its comfort levels are also excellent the cabin is beautifully appointed with carbon fiber panel inserts in place of the wood trim of the nine two s four all the expected gizmos are there heated seats power seats seat memory power this and that the glaring ommision was the trip computer which was removed because audi hasn t gotten it to work reliably yet that means that the car has no boost gauge a real disappointment taking into account how much the turbo dominates its performance unusual for the germans the s four comes with a honda style moonroof as well as the very intelligent dial a sunroof position rotary switch noise levels including engine and tire noise is so low that i wouldn t consider the lexus advantage in this area to be significant enough to sway a potential buyer five conclusion even though few will be able to afford an audi s four at its sticker price of four eight k the car is a bargain if one takes into account what it has to offer over the competition the two zero valve turbo five is a real gem even if it doesn t produce ferrari sounds no other luxury sports sedan maker offers the utter security of quattro all wheel drive which to some is worth the extra money all by itself the safety features are also top notch one nine nine four side impact standard compliant the very elegant automatic seat belt tensioners and the dual airbags the one zero zero series audis have been outstanding in government crash tests it gets my thumbs up for being so overwhelmingly capable rather than being all out exciting and intoxicating eliot

 from svec five menudo uh edu t c zhao subject full color image editor for sgi workstations organization university of houston lines one five nine distribution world nntp posting host menudo uh edu i am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on sgi gl besides typical touchup tasks such as crop rotate smooth etc bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image the following is the relevant sections from the man page pre release of may one nine nine three bit one l name bit bitmap image touchup for sgi workstations description bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on silicon graphics gl as a full color program bit handles images of both two four bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner as an image viewer bit allows list of images to be displayed in their original type two four bits or color index in any order and in any of the many built in styles of display you can walk up and down the list using mouse and keyboard or you can let bit do the walk for you the slideshow with the pan and zoom features large images can be viewed in full without being limited by the window or screen size as an image editor bit performs a large number of image editing and processing tasks accurately and efficiently it keeps information loss at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and or quantization of input images you can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into another in addition arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take advantage of the higher printer resolutions e g postscript bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be accessed by a press of a button and best of all the processed image will be read back and displayed immediately convolution using exter nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically giving great flexibility in processing an image features bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a continuous progress report and once the processing is complete the processed image will be displayed current features include o rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti aliasing and filling the rotated out region with an arbitrary color o scales an image by arbitrary factors in x and or y directions with the option of subpixel sampling o renders text of arbitrary color size or orientation on top of an image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving the text and raster separately such as into a postscript file to take advantage of a higher printer resolution besides normal text strings many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as in tex one e g alpha small beta produces greek alphabet alpha followed by a slightly smaller greek alphabet beta o presents graphically the histogram of an image o performs arbitrary one to one pixel transformation the transformation function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary forms further the transformation can be applied to rgb channels separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of it many difficult tasks such as thresholding can be accomplished rather easily by one to one transformation in combination with the avai lability of graphical histograms of the image o places simple geometric figures sgfs e g arrows circles trian gles etc of arbitrary color size and orientation into an image at arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some user definable coordinate system units with the option of rendering directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately e g postscript file all sgfs can be scaled in x and y directions independently or simultaneously this is how to get an ellipse from a circle o performs edge detection in combination with image histograms and one to one transformation very accurate result can be obtained o performs histogram equalization o performs convolution with externally defined square matrices of arbitrary order o crops a rectangular portion of an image o cuts and pastes across images o magnifies any portion of an image by any amount o displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause interval between images slideshow o measures rgb intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels along an arbitrary line with the result presented as rgb intensities or as an intensity vs distance plot o performs image type conversions o converts image formats o smoothes an image special convolution o filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image back and display it o modify an individual pixel s rgb values o performs fft on the entire image or a portion of it and display the resulting power spectra o spray and brush paint in full color unavailable in this pre release supported formats o iris rgb native to sgi iris o jpeg jfif format o compuserv gif o pnm portable any map including ppm pgm and pbm o xbm x window bitmap o tiff o postscript write only hardware requirements any sgi workstation that supports rgbmode including indigoes where to get it anonymous ftp to monte svec uh edu pub bit bitxxx tar z where xxx is the version number current version is zero seven three read src zero one readme for installation instructions after unpacking acknowledgement jpeg support is based on the independent jpeg groups s library version four forms library developed by mark overmars is used for gui both jpeg and forms library are included in this release bit is the program you will ever need to view and annotate images the built in editing features will satisfy most of your editing needs in addition the external filter and dynamical kernel will utilize any program you already have so try it and you will like it as always any comments bug reports are welcome

eight comp graphics three two six zero six ok with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with quicktime the effects of scaling and so on i thought i d do some more tests first of all i felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than realistic the movie i had been using only had one eight frames in it it was a version of the very first movie i created with the compact video compressor i decided something a little longer would give closer to real world results for better or for worse i pulled out a copy of two zero zero one a space odyssey that i had recorded off tv a while back about fifteen minutes into the movie there s a sequence where the earth shuttle is approaching the space station specifically i digitized a portion of about three zero seconds duration zooming in on the rotating space station i figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between frames to increase the differences between frames i digitized it at only five frames per second to give a total of one seven one frames i captured the raw footage at a resolution of three eight four two eight eight pixels with the spigot card in my centris six five zero quarter size resolution from a pal source i then imported it into premiere and put it through the compact video compressor keeping the five fps frame rate i created two versions of the movie one scaled to three two zero two four zero resolution the other at one six zero one two zero resolution i used the default two zero zero quality setting in premiere two zero one and specified a key frame every ten frames i then ran the three two zero two four zero movie through the same raw speed test program i used for the results i d been reporting earlier result a playback rate of over four five frames per second that s right i was getting a much higher result than with that first short test movie just for fun i copied the three two zero two four zero movie to my external hard disk a quantum lp one zero five s and ran it from there this time the playback rate was only about three five frames per second obviously the two three zero mb internal hard disk also a quantum is a significant contributor to the speed of playback i modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional scaling factors and tried playing back the one six zero one two zero movie scaled to three two zero two four zero size this time the playback speed was over six zero fps clearly the poster who observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing quicktime one zero in action not one five i d try my tests with quicktime one zero but i don t think it s entirely compatible with my centris and system seven one unscaled the playback rate for the one six zero one two zero movie was over one zero zero fps the other thing i tried was saving versions of the three two zero two four zero movie with preferred playback rates greater than one zero and seeing how well they played from within movieplayer ie with quicktime s normal synchronized playback a preferred rate of nine zero four five fps didn t work too well the playback was very jerky compare this with the raw speed test which achieved four five fps with ease i can t believe that quicktime s synchronization code would add this much overhead i think the slowdown was coming from the mac system s task switching a preferred rate of seven zero three five fps seemed to work fine i couldn t see any evidence of stutter at eight zero four zero fps i think i could see slight stutter but with four key frames every second it was hard to tell i guess i could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the key frames to make the stutter more noticeable of course this will also improve the compression slightly which should speed up the playback performance even more lawrence d oliveiro fone six four seven eight five six two eight eight nine computer services dept fax six four seven eight three eight four zero six six university of waikato electric mail ldo waikato ac nz hamilton new zealand three seven four seven two six s one seven five one nine seven e gmt one two zero zero i m afraid i missed the start of this thread but there are three factors that can significantly affect quicktime s playback speed that you may want to take into account one playback bit depth things are fastest when you play a movie back at the bit depth it was compressed for this is usually eight or one six bit but other depths are of course possible two type of scaling qt is optimized for double size scaling other scaling factors hit peformance much harder three playback window position movieplayer limits your window placement choices to advantagous pixel boundaries by default i m not sure about premiere any combination of those can radically alter playback performance image size is of course another biggie giving the movie player lots of ram can also make a real difference forgive me if these were mentioned earlier in

 from val fcom cc utah edu val kartchner subject re where did the hacker ethic go organization university of utah computer center x newsreader tin version one one pl eight lines one three three vinci filipe vxcrna cern ch wrote in article bobp hal com bob pendleton writes from article by mwmeyer ingres com mike wading through the muck and meyer in article bobp hal com bob pendleton writes this is getting pretty silly first off hacker is an obsolete term doesn t matter what it used to mean today it means thief it only means thief if you want it to mean that to me it means lots of context wickedly omitted by myself anyway if i say joe is a hacker to most english speaking people who know the word they ll probably think he is either a poor golfer or a bad carpenter but there are very very few people who will think he is a good and clever programmer if you chose to call yourself by a term that means thief don t be surprised when people think you are a thief even if you don t agree with that definition of the word the narrower view that a hacker when associated with the computing environment is a dishonest expert is not so widespread i m my opinion at least with the people involved with the field imho the wider meaning is not obsolete at all no matter how much the lay press would like it to be therefore i conclude that if you call yourself a hacker and somebody perceives you as a thief then this person belongs to a very very small group that has some computer knowledge but not enough to know the wider and original meaning of the word unfortunately the general public has a very narrow view of the deep dark recesses of the art of computing what little they do see is from the view given to them by the media from what i have seen from the media hacker is not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person i on the other hand know what hacker means from those who consider themselves such following is the definition from jargon file two nine one zero this is also known as the hackers dictionary the definitions are arranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage hacker originally someone who makes furniture with an axe n one a person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities as opposed to most users who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary two one who programs enthusiastically even obsessively or who enjoys programming rather than just theorizing about programming three a person capable of appreciating four a person who is good at programming quickly five an expert at a particular program or one who frequently does work using it or on it as in a unix hacker definitions one through five are correlated and people who fit them congregate six an expert or enthusiast of any kind one might be an astronomy hacker for example seven one who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing limitations eight deprecated a malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive information by poking around hence password hacker network hacker see the term hacker also tends to connote membership in the global community defined by the net see and it also implies that the person described is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic see it is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe oneself that way hackers consider themselves something of an elite a meritocracy based on ability though one to which new members are gladly welcome there is thus a certain ego satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker but if you claim to be one and are not you ll quickly be labeled see also hacker ethic the n one the belief that information sharing is a powerful positive good and that it is an ethical duty of hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and facilitating access to information and to computing resources wherever possible two the belief that system cracking for fun and exploration is ethically ok as long as the cracker commits no theft vandalism or breach of confidentiality both of these normative ethical principles are widely but by no means universally accepted among hackers most hackers subscribe to the hacker ethic in sense one and many act on it by writing and giving away free software a few go further and assert that all information should be free and any proprietary control of it is bad this is the philosophy behind the project sense two is more controversial some people consider the act of cracking itself to be unethical like breaking and entering but this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who see themselves as benign crackers see also on this view it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy to a break into a system and then b explain to the sysop preferably by email from a account exactly how it was done and how the hole can be plugged acting as an unpaid an unsolicited the most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share technical tricks software and where possible computing resources with other hackers huge cooperative networks such as and internet see can function without central control because of this trait they both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be hackerdom s most valuable intangible asset finally a true hacker does not name himself herself one for this is a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large to me a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who says nahh i just know a thing or two people always exagerate note that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing limself meaning himself herself one but simply says that it is better not to do so there are many who do not know the meaning of hacker so in order to defend the true meaning of the word it is sometimes necessary to borrow on the reputation of a known respected hacker around the workplace this means that hacker is defined in terms of some well known and respected person sometimes there may only be one such person no matter what mr dumpty says language doesn t work that way actually it does you just have to get adequate press coverage language works anyway that we want it to work the purpose of language is to communicate to oversimplify as

myname mysite to specify your correct e mail address to reply to one what is jpeg jpeg pronounced jay peg is a standardized image compression mechanism jpeg stands for joint photographic experts group the original name of the committee that wrote the standard jpeg is designed for compressing either full color or gray scale digital images of natural real world scenes it does not work so well on non realistic images such as cartoons or line drawings jpeg does not handle black and white one bit per pixel images nor does it handle motion picture compression standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees named jbig and mpeg respectively jpeg is lossy meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn t quite identical to what you originally put in the algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye notably the fact that small color details aren t perceived as well as small details of light and dark thus jpeg is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans if you plan to machine analyze your images the small errors introduced by jpeg may be a problem for you even if they are invisible to the eye a useful property of jpeg is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters this means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality you can make extremely small files if you don t mind poor quality this is useful for indexing image archives making thumbnail views or icons etc etc conversely if you aren t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied and accept lesser compression two why use jpeg there are two good reasons to make your image files smaller and to store two four bit per pixel color data instead of eight bit per pixel data making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images being able to compress a two mbyte full color file down to one zero zero kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time if you are comparing gif and jpeg the size ratio is more like four to one more details below if your viewing software doesn t support jpeg directly you ll have to convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images even with a jpeg capable viewer it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format gif for instance thus using jpeg is essentially a time space tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply it s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file i ll let you do the arithmetic yourself the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet posting format is that jpeg can store full color information two four bits pixel one six million colors instead of eight or less two five six or fewer colors if you have only eight bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you within a couple of years though eight bit gif will look as obsolete as black and white macpaint format does today furthermore for reasons detailed in section seven jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware hence jpeg is considerably more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard three when should i use jpeg and when should i stick with gif jpeg is not going to displace gif entirely for some types of images gif is superior in image quality file size or both one of the first things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to as a rule of thumb jpeg is superior to gif for storing full color or gray scale images of realistic scenes that means scanned photographs and similar material jpeg is superior even if you don t have two four bit display hardware and it is a lot superior if you do see section seven for details gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors such as cartoons and line drawings in particular large areas of pixels that are all exactly the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by gif jpeg can t squeeze these files as much as gif does without introducing visible defects this sort of image is best kept in gif form in particular single color borders are quite cheap in gif files but they should be avoided in jpeg files jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges a row of pure black pixels adjacent to a row of pure white pixels for example sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting again this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs but it shows up fairly often in gif files borders overlaid text etc the blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that s only a few pixels high if you have a gif with a lot of small size overlaid text don t jpeg it computer drawn images ray traced scenes for instance usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity the more complex and subtly rendered the image the more likely that jpeg will do well on it the same goes for semi realistic artwork fantasy drawings and such plain black and white two level images should never be converted to jpeg you need at least about one six gray levels before jpeg is useful for gray scale images it should also be noted that gif is lossless for gray scale images of up to two five six levels while jpeg is not if you have an existing library of gif images you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg you will lose a little image quality if you do section seven which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif only applies if both formats start from a full color original if you start from a gif you ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information jpeg can only make things worse however the disk space savings may justify converting anyway this is a decision you ll have to make for yourself if you do convert a gif library to jpeg see section one four for hints be prepared to leave some images in gif format since some gifs will not convert well four how well does jpeg compress images pretty darn well here are some sample file sizes for an image i have handy a seven two seven x five two five full color image of a ship in a harbor the first three files are for comparison purposes the rest were created with the free jpeg software described in section six b file size in bytes comments ship ppm one one four five zero four zero original file in ppm format no compression two four bits or three bytes per pixel plus a few bytes overhead ship ppm z nine six three eight two nine ppm file passed through unix compress compress doesn t accomplish a lot you ll note other text oriented compressors give similar results ship gif two four zero four three eight converted to gif with ppmquant fs two five six ppmtogif most of the savings is the result of losing color info gif saves eight bits pixel not two four see sec seven ship jpg nine five one five five six two two cjpeg q nine five highest useful quality setting this is indistinguishable from the two four bit original at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs ship jpg seven five five eight zero zero nine cjpeg q seven five default setting you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this from the original even with both on screen at once ship jpg five zero three eight four zero six cjpeg q five zero this has slight defects if you know what to look for you could tell it s been jpeged without seeing the original still as good image quality as many recent postings in usenet pictures groups ship jpg two five two five one nine two cjpeg q two five jpeg s characteristic blockiness becomes apparent at this setting djpeg blocksmooth helps some still i ve seen plenty of usenet postings that were of poorer image quality than this ship jpg five o six five eight seven cjpeg q five optimize optimize cuts table overhead blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or indexing purposes note that this file is tiny the compression ratio from the original is one seven three one in this case jpeg can make a file that s a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of comparable quality the q seven five file is every bit as good as the gif better if you have a full color display this seems to be a typical ratio for real world scenes five what are good quality settings for jpeg most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting there seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings quality nine five does not mean keep nine five of the information as some have claimed the quality scale is purely arbitrary it s not a percentage of anything the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting smallest file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here are some rules of thumb the default quality setting q seven five is very often the best choice this setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image try q seven five first if you see defects then go up except for experimental purposes never go above q nine five saying q one zero zero will produce a file two or three times as large as q nine five but of hardly any better quality if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to q five zero without objectionable degradation on the other hand you might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg the default q seven five is about right for compressing two four bit images but q eight five to nine five is usually better for converting gifs see section one four for more info if you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purposes and are prepared to tolerate large defects a q setting in the range of five to one zero is about right q two or so may be amusing as op art note the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section six b and to many programs based on it other jpeg implementations such as image alchemy may use a completely different quality scale some programs don t even provide a numeric scale just high medium low style choices six where can i get jpeg software most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp if you don t know how to use ftp see the faq article how to find sources if you don t have direct access to ftp read about ftpmail servers in the same article that article appears regularly in news answers or you can get it by sending e mail to mail server rtfm mit edu with send usenet news answers finding sources in the body the anonymous ftp list faq may also be helpful it s usenet news answers ftp list faq in the news answers archive note this list changes constantly if you have a copy more than a couple months old get the latest jpeg faq from the news answers archive six a if you are looking for canned software viewers etc the first part of this list is system specific programs that only run on one kind of system if you don t see what you want for your machine check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over internet but some commercial programs are listed too x windows xv shareware two five is an excellent viewer for jpeg gif and many other image formats it can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations it s available for ftp from export lcs mit edu one eight two four zero one two file contrib xv three zero zero tar z version three zero zero is a major upgrade with support for two four bit displays and many other improvements however it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking if you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge stick with version two two one also available from export note that version two two one is not a good choice if you have a two four bit display you ll get only eight bit color nor for converting two four bit images to jpeg but two two one works fine for converting gif and other eight bit images to jpeg caution there is a glitch in version two two one be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when saving a jpeg file or the file will be blurry another good choice for x windows is john cristy s free imagemagick package also available from export lcs mit edu file contrib imagemagick tar z this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks the imagemagick viewer handles two four bit displays correctly for colormapped displays it does better though slower color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software both of the above are large complex packages if you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest release three zero three xloadimage is free and available from export lcs mit edu file contrib xloadimage three zero three tar z xli is a variant version of xloadimage said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to jpeg files because it has the ijg v four decoder while xloadimage three zero three is using a hacked over v one the next xloadimage release will fix this xli is also free and available from export lcs mit edu file contrib xli one one four tar z both programs are said to do the right thing with two four bit displays ms dos this covers plain dos for windows or os two programs see the next headings one good choice is eric praetzel s free dvpeg which views jpeg and gif files the current version two five is available by ftp from sunee uwaterloo ca one two nine nine seven five zero five zero file pub jpeg viewers dvpeg two five zip this is a good basic viewer that works on either two eight six or three eight six four eight six machines the user interface is not flashy but it s functional another freeware jpeg gif tga viewer is mohammad rezaei s hiview the current version one two is available from simtel two zero and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics hv one two zip hiview requires a three eight six or better cpu and a vcpi compatible memory manager qemm three eight six and three eight six max work windows and os two do not hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen for larger images it scales the image down to fit on the screen rather than using panning scrolling as most viewers do you may or may not prefer this approach but there s no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably note installation is a bit tricky read the directions carefully a shareware alternative is colorview for dos three zero this is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives its user interface is also much spiffier looking although personally i find it harder to use more keystrokes inconsistent behavior it is faster than dvpeg but a little slower than hiview at least on my hardware for images larger than screen size dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed and both are faster than hiview the current version is two one available from simtel two zero and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics dcview two one zip requires a vesa graphics driver if you don t have one look in vesadrv two zip or vesa tsr zip from the same directory many recent pcs have a built in vesa driver so don t try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains that the driver is missing a second shareware alternative is fullview which has been kicking around the net for a while but i don t know any stable archive location for it the current rather old version is inferior to the above viewers anyway the author tells me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the simtel two zero archives at that time the well known gif viewer compushow cshow supports jpeg in its latest revision eight six zero a however cshow s jpeg implementation isn t very good it s slow about half the speed of the above viewers and image

one that can deal with jpeg images much over six four zero x four eight zero pixels on a typical four mb mac given a large image jpegview automatically scales it down to fit on the screen rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers you can zoom in on any desired portion though some people like this behavior some don t overall jpegview s user interface is very well thought out

pictpixie was intended as a developer s tool and it s really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a two four bit display and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface worse pictpixie is an unsupported program meaning it has some minor bugs that apple does not intend to fix there is an old version of pictpixie called pictcompressor floating around the net if you have this you should trash it as it s even buggier also the quicktime starter kit includes a much cleaned up descendant of pictpixie called picture compressor note that picture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the net storm technology s picture decompress is a free jpeg viewer converter this rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways but it will run without system seven or quicktime so you may be forced to use it on

independent jpeg group is a volunteer organization if you d like to contribute to improving our software you are welcome to join seven what s all this hoopla about color quantization most people don t have full color two four bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware stores eight or fewer bits per pixel so it can display two five six or fewer distinct colors at a time to display a full color image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors this process is called color quantization this is something of a misnomer color selection would be a better term we re stuck with the standard usage though clearly color quantization is a lossy process it turns out that for most images the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg except at the very lowest jpeg quality settings since jpeg is a full color format converting a color jpeg image for display on eight bit or less hardware requires color quantization this is true for all color jpegs even if you feed a two five six or less color gif into jpeg what comes out of the decompressor is not two five six colors but thousands of colors this happens because jpeg s lossiness affects each pixel a little differently so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors each original color gets smeared into a group of nearby colors therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display regardless of the image source the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray scale output incidentally because of this effect it s nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a jpeg image even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values different jpeg decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences i occasionally see posted images described as two five six color jpeg this tells me that the poster a hasn t read this faq and b probably converted the jpeg from a gif jpegs can be classified as color or gray scale just like photographs but number of colors just isn t a useful concept for jpeg on the other hand a gif image by definition has already been quantized to two five six or fewer colors a gif does have a definite number of colors in its palette and the format doesn t allow more than two five six palette entries for purposes of usenet picture distribution gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization so recipients don t have to this is also the disadvantage of gif you re stuck with the sender s quantization if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display you have to re quantize resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full color image furthermore if the sender didn t use a high quality color quantization algorithm you re out of luck for this reason jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don t match the sender s display hardware jpeg s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user s display hardware furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms there is a lot of active research in this area or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of jpeg images you already have with a gif you re stuck forevermore with what was sent it s also worth mentioning that many gif viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines if you view a two five six color gif on a one six color ega display for example you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations one to create the gif one to display it but often it s also due to sloppiness jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed thus jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average gif program for low color resolution displays as well as high resolution ones finally an ever growing number of people have better than eight bit display hardware already one five bit hi color pc displays true two four bit displays on workstations and macintoshes etc for these people gif is already obsolete as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively thus jpeg is an all around better choice than gif for representing images in a machine independent fashion eight how does jpeg work the buzz words to know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and huffman or arithmetic entropy coding this article s long enough already so i m not going to say more than that here for technical information see the comp compression faq this is available from the news answers archive at rtfm mit edu in files pub usenet news answers compression faq part one three if you need help in using the news answers archive see the top of this article nine what about lossless jpeg there s a great deal of confusion on this subject the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm i e one that guarantees the final output is bit for bit identical to the original input however this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular lossy jpeg algorithm and it offers much less compression at present very few implementations of lossless jpeg exist and all of them are commercial saying q one zero zero to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step with the v four free jpeg code you can also say sample one x one to turn off subsampling keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value it s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image at this minimum loss setting regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed two four bit per pixel image true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantees bit for bit accuracy if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than six bits per pixel per color component you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard this performs better than jpeg lossless on such images jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with six or more bits per pixel furthermore jpeg is public domain at least with a huffman back end while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents one zero why all the argument about file formats strictly speaking jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms it does not refer to a specific image file format the jpeg committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations since we can t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leaves us with a problem in the absence of official standards a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to do their own thing and as a result their programs aren t compatible with anybody else s the closest thing we have to a de facto standard jpeg format is some work that s been coordinated by people at c cube microsystems they have defined two jpeg based file formats jfif jpeg file interchange format a low end format that transports pixels and not much else tiff jpeg aka tiff six zero an extension of the aldus tiff format tiff is a high end format that will let you record just about everything you ever wanted to know about an image and a lot more besides tiff is a lot more complex than jfif and may well prove less transportable because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different and incompatible subsets of tiff it s not likely that adding jpeg to the mix will do anything to improve this situation both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of jpeg related products it s reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in picture postings jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now the tiff six zero spec has only recently been officially adopted and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details even when tiff jpeg is well defined the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common denominator tiff jpeg files may never be as transportable a particular case that people may be interested in is apple s quicktime software for the macintosh quicktime uses a jfif compatible format wrapped inside the mac specific pict structure conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward and several mac programs are available to do it see mac portion of section six a if you have an editor that handles binary files you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand see section one one for details another particular case is handmade software s programs gif two jpg jpg two gif and image alchemy these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif format by default though they write a proprietary format developed by hsi this format is not readable by any non hsi programs and should not be used for usenet postings use the j switch to get jfif output this applies to old versions of these programs the current releases emit jfif format by default you still should be careful not to post hsi format files unless you want to get flamed by people on non pc platforms one one how do i recognize which file format i have and what do i do about it if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software won t read it s likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpeg based format you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file one a jfif standard file will start with the characters hex ff d eight ff e zero followed by two variable bytes often hex zero zero one zero followed by jfif two if you see ff d eight at the start but not the rest of it you may have a raw jpeg file this is probably decodable as is by jfif software it s worth a try anyway three hsi files start with hsi one you re out of luck unless you have hsi software portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data but they won t decompress properly with non hsi programs four a macintosh pict file if jpeg compressed will have a couple hundred bytes of header followed by a jfif header scan for jfif strip off everything before the ff d eight and you should be able to read it five anything else it s a proprietary format or not jpeg at all if you are lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream look for ff d eight try stripping off everything before that in uuencoded usenet postings the characteristic jfif pattern is begin line m c x whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with begin line m i if you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non jfif files one two what about arithmetic coding the jpeg spec defines two different back end modules for the final output of compressed data either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed the choice has no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file on typical images arithmetic coding produces a file five or one zero percent smaller than huffman coding all the file size numbers previously cited are for huffman coding unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm at the space savings isn t great enough to justify the potential legal hassles in particular arithmetic coding should not be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future stay tuned for further details one three does loss accumulate with repeated compression decompression it would be nice if having compressed an image with jpeg you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially unfortunately this is not the case in general recompressing an altered image loses more information though usually not as much as was lost the first time around the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it without changing it then there is no further loss i e you get an identical jpeg file even this is not true at least not with the current free jpeg software it s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error if you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first generation output it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change one of the things on our to do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited but i am not optimistic about it in any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full color output of djpeg at the original quality setting would introduce no further loss even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff error degradation if you re wondering why it s because the pixel block boundaries move if you cropped off only multiples of one six pixels you might be safe but that s a mighty limited capability the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images but you don t want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps use a lossless format ppm rle tiff etc while working on the image then jpeg it when you are ready to file it away aside from avoiding degradation you will save a lot of compression decompression time this way one four what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg as stated earlier you will lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to jpeg if you can obtain the original full color data the gif was made from it s far better to make a jpeg from that but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg to make sure you are happy with it before throwing away the corresponding gif that will give you a chance to re do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary some gifs may be better left as gifs as explained in section three in particular cartoon type gifs with sixteen or fewer colors don t convert well you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be larger than the gif so check the sizes too experience to date suggests that large high visual quality gifs are the best candidates for conversion to jpeg they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings and they convert to jpeg with least degradation don t waste your time converting any gif much under one zero zero kbytes also don t expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created directly from full color originals to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight through jpeg files would be i e shoot for one two or one three rd the size of the gif file not one four th as suggested in earlier comparisons many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant color border around a gif image while useless this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in gif files it is not free in jpeg files and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ghost edges do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging if you are on an x windows system xv s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this cjpeg s default q setting of seven five is appropriate for full color input but for gif inputs q settings of eight five to nine five often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation if you apply smoothing as suggested below the higher q setting may not be necessary color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool your eye into seeing more than the two five six colors that gif can actually store if you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value the trouble with dithering is that to jpeg it looks like high spatial frequency color noise and jpeg can t compress noise very well the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image if you had it to get around this you want to smooth the gif image before compression smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q factor thus further reducing the size of the compressed file while still obtaining a better looking output image than you d get without smoothing with the v four free jpeg software or products based on it a simple smoothing capability is built in try smooth one zero or so when converting gifs values of one zero to two five seem to work well for high quality gifs heavy handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors if you can see regular fine scale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement then strong smoothing is definitely called for too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image which you don t want if you are an image processing wizard you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program such as pnmconvol from the pbmplus package however cjpeg s built in smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol the upshot of all this is that cjpeg quality eight five smooth one zero is

like this you may find useful information there eight format documents for tiff iff biff nff off fits etc you almost certainly don t need these read the above item seven on free image manipulation

converting from hpgl to postscript or macdraw to cgm or whatever it is important to understand that this is a very different problem from the image format conversions in item seven converting one image format to another is a fairly easy problem since once you get past all the file header junk a pixel is a pixel the basic objects are the same for all image formats this is not so for vector formats the basic objects circles ellipses drop shadowed pattern filled round cornered rectangles etc vary from one format to another except in extremely restricted cases it is simply not possible to do a one to one conversion between vector formats there is software for converting to and from cgm files on ftp psc edu the contributor states that it runs on unix ms windows and possibly the mac a better more specific blurb would be most welcome on the other hand it is quite possible to do a close approximation rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another as far as i know no one has put together a general toolkit of such converters but two different hpgl to postscript converters have been posted to comp sources misc check the index on your nearest archive site a related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format to a bitmapped image from postscript to sun raster format or hpgl to x one one bitmap for example some of the commercial postscript clones for pc s allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer also the postscript interpreters in the next box and in sun s x one one news can be used to render to a file if you re clever but in general the answer is no however if someone were to put together a vector to vector conversion toolkit adding a vector to raster converter would be trivial gnu ghostscript from the fsf current version two five two includes drivers for both ppm and gif format files thus it can be used as a postscript to ppm or a postscript to gif filter it implements essentially all of postscript level one

one four how to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to infinity if it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way the point is within the polygon if the ray crosses an even number of edges the point is either outside the polygon or within an interior hole formed from intersecting polygon edges this idea is known in the trade as the jordan curve theorem see eric haines article in glassner s ray tracing book above for more information including treatment of special cases another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all the vertices on the polygon if the sum is two pi the point is inside if the sum is zero the point is outside however this method is about an order of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the trigonometric functions is usually quite costly code for both methods plus barycentric triangle testing can be found in the ray tracing news vol

 from gorgen ann arbor applicon slb com david gorgen subject need help z buffering lines ann arbor mi usa keywords z buffer roundoff lines areas lines eight four i m asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low apparent precision in z buffering that i ve encountered in two different pex implementations i can t find any discussion of this problem in any resources i can lay hands on e g the comp windows x pex faq gaskins s pexlib programming manual vendors documentation i m posting this article by itself on comp graphics and virtually the same article with a test program demonstrating the problem on comp windows x pex the problem is hard to describe without pictures hence this article is longish if you can run pexlib five x programs and are interested i encourage you to build and run the test program in comp windows x pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach to dealing with it it depends on the utility code from the above gaskins book instructions for fetching it via anonymous ftp are given the problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize stitching artifacts resulting from the use of z buffering with polylines that are coplanar with filled areas the interpolated z values along a line will differ slightly due to roundoff error from the interpolated z values across an area even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with vertices of the area because of this it s a tossup whether the z buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed visually the result tends to be a dashed line effect even though the line is supposed to be solid using the pexlib api my approach to a solution is to use two slightly different pex view mapping transforms in two view table entries one for the areas and one for the lines the pex structures or immediate mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in effect for areas and the other is always in effect for lines the result is a slight shift in npc z coordinates for the lines so as to attempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines this shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used in the pexlib view table entry for lines just a hair backwards i e smaller vrc z coordinates compared to their positions in the view table entry used for areas this means that when a point is transformed to npc its z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than if it comes from an area thus accomplishing the desired bias i would expect the z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount to a few units at most out of the entire dynamic range of the z buffer typically from zero to six five five three five if not one six seven seven seven two one five i e one six or two four bit z buffers therefore it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of z in vrc between the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix the stitching but in fact experience shows that the shift has to be as much as zero zero zero three to zero zero zero six of the range empirically it s worst when the npc z component of the slope of the surface is high i e when it appears more or less edge on to the viewer it s as if only eight or nine bits of the z buffer have any dependable meaning this amount is so great that one problem is replaced by another sometimes the polylines show through areas which they are supposed to lie behind i ve observed the problem on both hewlett packard and digital workstation pex servers to approximately the same degree the test program demonstrates the problem on an mit pexlib five x implementation this version is known to compile and run on an hp ux system with pex five one open questions one why does this happen am i configuring the pex view table wrongly is there a systematic difference in z interpolation for lines as opposed to areas e g pixel centers versus corners which could be corrected for are pex implementors wantonly discarding z precision in their interpolators something else two what to do about it can i fix my use of the view table to allow better precision in z buffered hlhsr is there another approach i can take to remove the stitching artifacts am i just out of luck any help would be immensely appreciated dave gorgen internet gorgen ann arbor applicon slb com applicon inc gorgen aaaca one sinet slb com ann arbor michigan usa uucp uunet sharkey applga gorgen

 from graeme labtam labtam oz au graeme gill subject re gamma correction organization labtam australia pty ltd melbourne australia summary here is a faq contribution on gamma lines one eight four in article madler cco caltech edu mark adler writes can someone who knows what they re talking about add a faq entry on gamma correction thanks i get regular questions about gamma correction since i go to great pains to deal with it properly in xli the image loader program i maintain here is an explanation i often use to answer these questions this might be suitable for inclusion in the faq graeme gill a note on gamma correction and images author graeme w gill graeme labtam oz au date nine three five one six what is all this gamma stuff anyway although it would be nice to think that an image is an image there are a lot of complications not only are there a whole bunch of different image formats gif jpeg tiff etc etc there is a whole lot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit complicated gamma is one of those things if you ve ever downloaded images from bbs or the net you ve probably noticed with most image viewing programs that some images look ok some look too dark and some look too light why is this you may ask this is gamma correction or the lack of it why do we need gamma correction at all gamma correction is needed because of the nature of crts cathode ray tubes the monitors usually used for viewing images if you have some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer image by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of the scene then you have created a linear or un gamma corrected image this is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate the image as if the values in the image file were light ie adding and multiplying will work just like real light in the real world now if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage and feed it into a crt you find that the crt doesn t give you an amount of light proportional to the voltage the amount of light coming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage something like this light out voltage crt gamma so if you just dump your nice linear image out to a crt the image will look much too dark to fix this up you have to gamma correct the image first you need to do the opposite of what the crt will do to the image so that things cancel out and you get what you want so you have to do this to your image gamma corrected image image one crt gamma for most crts the crt gamma is somewhere between one zero and three zero if that is all it is why does it seem so complicated the problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction also not all sources of images give you linear images video cameras or video signals in general because of this a lot of images already have some gamma correction done to them and you are rarely sure how much if you try and display one of those images with a program that does gamma correction for you the image gets corrected twice and looks way to light if you display one of those images with a program that doesn t do gamma correction then it will look vaguely right but not perfect because the gamma correction is not exactly right for you particular crt whose fault is all this it is really three things one is all those display programs out there that don t do gamma correction properly another is that most image formats don t specify a standard gamma or don t have some way or recording what their gamma correction is the third thing is that not many people understand what gamma correction is all about and create a lot of images with varying gamma s at least two file formats do the right thing the utah graphics toolkit rle format has a semi standard way of recording the gamma of an image the jfif file standard that uses jpeg compression specifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of one zero ie a linear image but not everyone obeys the rules some image loaders for instance xli an x one one image utility allow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you are using but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to view other image viewers eg xv another x one one image program and utilities eg the pbm toolkit provide ways of changing the gamma of an image but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction yourself allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has and then the gamma correction you need to suite your crt monitor note that xv two two one doesn t provide an easy way of modifying the gamma of an image you need to adjust the r g and b curves to the appropriate gamma in the coledit controls altering the intensity in the hsv controls doesn t do the right thing as it fails to take account of the effect gamma has on h and s this tends to give a tint to the image how can i figure out what my viewer does or what gamma my screen has the simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma jpg provided with xli distribution which is a jfif jpeg format file containing two grayscale ramps the ramps are chosen to look linear to the human eye one using continuous tones and the other using dithering if your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects images then the two ramps should look symmetrical and the point at which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half way from the top to the bottom to find this point it helps if you move away a little from the screen and de focus your eyes a bit if your viewer doesn t do gamma correction then left hand ramp will have a long dark part and a short white part and the point of equal brightness will be above the center if your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction for a display then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the gamma and decrease it if it is below the center the value will usually be around two two with xli for instance you can adjust the display gamma with the dispgamma flag and once you ve got it right you can set the display gamma environment variable in your profile how do i figure out what the gamma of an image is this is the most tricky bit as a general rule it seems that a lot of true color ie two four bit ppm jpg images have a gamma of one zero linear although there are many about that have some gamma correction it seems that the majority of pseudo color images ie eight bit images with color maps gif etc are gamma corrected to some degree or other if your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will look good and gamma corrected images will look too light if your viewer doesn t do gamma correction then linear images will look too dark and gamma corrected images will ok why linear images are sometimes not such a good thing one of the reason that many high quality formats such as video use gamma correction is that it actually makes better use of the storage medium this is because the human eye has a logarithmic response to light and gamma correction has a similar compression characteristic this means images could make better use of eight bits per color for instance if they used gamma correction the implication though is that every time you want to do any image processing you should convert the eight bit image to one two or so linear bits to retain the same accuracy since little popular software does this and none of the popular image formats can agree on a standard gamma correction factor it is difficult to justify gamma corrected images at the popular level if some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma and if image manipulation software takes care to use extra precision when dealing with linearized internal data then gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing i am told that the kodak photocd format for instance has a standard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the highest quality out of the bits used to hold the image

expect for idl and the other should be free those are the general purpose packages i ve heard of besides what terramar has sips was written for aviris imagery i m not sure how general purpose it is you would have to contact goetz or one of his people and ask i have another piece of software pcw that does pc and walsh transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image modification you can compute an image using selected components i ve used it on seven zero megabyte aviris images without problems but for the best speed you need an external dsp card it will work without it but large images take quite a while five zero seven zero times as long to process that s a freebie if you want it my favorite is idl interactive data language from research systems inc idl is in my opinion much better and infinitely easier its programming language is very strong and easy very pascal like it handles the number crunching very well also personally i like doing the number crunching with idl on the vax or mathematica igor or even excel on the mac if it s not too hairy then bringing it over to nih image for the imaging part i have yet to encounter any situation which that combination couldn t handle and the speed and ease of use compared to iraf was incredible by the way it s mostly astronomical image processing which i ve been doing this means image enhancement cleaning up bad lines pixels and some other traditional image processing routines then for example taking a graph of intensity versus position along a line i choose with the mouse then doing a curve

intergraph workstations a unix machine similar to a sun though there were rumors there are always rumors that the software would be ported to pc and possibly a sun environment pci a company called pci inc out of richmond hill ontario canada makes an array of software utilities for processing manipulation and use of remote sensing data in eight or ten different industry standard formats lgsowg bsq landsat and a couple of others whose titles i forget the software is available in versions for ms dos unix workstations among them hp sun and ibm and vms and quite possibly other platforms by now i use the vms version the pci software consists of several classes groups packages of utilities grouped by function but all operating on a common pci database disk file the tape i o package is a set of utility programs which read from the various remote sensing industry tape formats into or write those formats out from the pci database file this is the only package i use or know much about other packages can display data from the pci database to one or another of several pci supported third party color displays output numeric or bitmap representation of image data to an attached printer e g an epson type dot matrix graphics printer you might be more spe cifically interested in the mathematical operations package histo gram and fourier analysis equalization user specified operations e g multiply channel one by three add channel two and store as channel five and god only knows what all else there s a lot i don t have and don t use these so can t say much about them you only buy the packages your particular application interest calls for each utility is controlled by from one to eight parameters read from a common parameter file which must be in vms anyway in your default directory some utilities will share parameters and use the same parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit confusing setting up a series of operations the standard pci environment contains a scripting language very similar to ibm pc basic but which allows you to automate the process of setting up parameters for a common complicated lengthy or difficult series of utility executions in vms i can also invoke utilities independently from a dcl command procedure there s also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled language programs which can interface with read from write to the pci data structures database file parameter file the pci software is designed specifically for remote sensing images but requires such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the level where you can handle r s images you can figure out ways to handle a few other things as well for instance the tape i o package offers a utility for reading headerless multi band what adobe photoshop on the macintosh calls raw data from tape in a number of different interleave orders this turns out to be ideal for manipulating the graphic arts industry s ct two t format would probably i haven t tried handle targa and so on above all however you have to know what you re doing or you can screw up to the nth degree and have to start over it s worth noting that the pci database file is designed to contain not only raster image data but vectors for overlaying map information entered via digitizing table land use and all manner of other information i observe that a remote sensing image tape often contains all manner of information about the spectral bands latitude longitude time date etc of the original satellite pass all of this can go into the pci database i believe that on workstations the built in display is used on vax systems other than workstations pci supports only a couple of specific third party display systems the name gould deanza seems to come to mind one of my personal workarounds was a display program which would display directly from a pci database file to a peritek vct q q bus two four bit directcolor display subsystem pci software could be overkill in your case it seems designed for the very high end applications users i e those for whom a mac pc largely doesn t suffice although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time it s probably no coincidence that pci is located in canada a country which does a lot of its land resource management via remote sensing i believe the canadian government uses pci software for some of its work in these areas spam spectral analysis manager back in one nine eight five jpl developed something called spam spectral analysis manager which got a fair amount of use at the time that was designed for airborne imaging spectrometer imagery byte data two five six pixels across by five one two lines by two five six bands a modified version has since been developed for aviris airborne visual and infrared imaging spectrometer which uses much larger images spam does none of these things rectification classification pc and ihs transformations filtering contrast enhancement overlays actually it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement stretching spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering the original spam uses x or sunview to display the aviris version may

image processing applications robotics medical satellite engineering oil exploration etc it is called hips and deals with sequences of multiband images in the same way it deals with single images it has been growing since we first wrote it both by additions from us as well as a huge user contributed library feature description hips is a set of image processing modules which together provide a powerful suite of tools for those interested in research system development and teaching it handles sequences of images movies in precisely the same manner as single frames programs and subroutines have been developed for simple image transformations filtering convolution fourier and other transform processing edge detection and line drawing manipulation digital image compression and transmission methods noise generation and image statistics computation over one five zero such image transformation programs have been developed as a result almost any image processing task can be performed quickly and conveniently additionally hips allows users to easily integrate their own custom routines new users become effective using hips on their first day hips features images that are self documenting each image stored in the system contains a history of the transformations that have been applied to that image hips includes a small set of subroutines which primarily deals with a standardized image sequence header and a large library of image transformation tools in the form of unix filters it comes complete with source code on line manual pages and on line documentation host configuration requirements originally developed at new york university hips now represents one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image processing environments currently available it runs under the unix operating system it is modular and flexible provides automatic documentation of its actions and is almost entirely independent of special equipment hips is now in use on a variety of computers including vax and microvax sun apollo masscomp ncr tower iris ibm at etc for image display and input drivers are supplied for the grinnell and adage ikonas image processors and the sun two

watson ibm com organization visualization systems ibm keywords computer graphics ray tracing volume rendering scientific visualization of chemical systems cornell theory center summer school offered through the cornell school of continuing education and summer sessions course description within the past ten years the simulation and modeling of lines one nine seven molecules has evolved from an esoteric academic subject into a international industry computer graphics has played a decisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists to build visualize and interact with complex geometrical objects while computer scientists are conversant in the language of their own discipline they are often unfamiliar with the terminology simulation techniques and practical needs of research chemists similarly chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigms and technological advances in graphical computing this interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gap between computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistry researchers who wish to be more than just casual users of prepackaged graphics software although this is not intended to be a course in computational chemistry or drug design data sets from chemical research problems will be used in lab and students will be encouraged to bring data sets of their own lab exercises and projects will be carried out using data flow programming ibm visualization data explorer software and students will have access to cornell theory center computing resources including video recording equipment audience researchers and students in the chemical and biological sciences interested in integrating state of the art computer graphics into their research computer scientists wishing to gain familiarity with a major application of scientific visualization the class size will be limited to two five participants on a first come first served basis level graduate advanced undergraduate one or two credits may be

to reply to one what is jpeg jpeg pronounced jay peg is a standardized image compression mechanism jpeg stands for joint photographic experts group the original name of the committee that wrote the standard jpeg is designed for compressing either full color or gray scale digital images of natural real world scenes it does not work so well on non realistic images such as cartoons or line drawings jpeg does not handle black and white one bit per pixel images nor does it handle motion picture compression standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees named jbig and mpeg respectively jpeg is lossy meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn t quite identical to what you originally put in the algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye notably the fact that small color details aren t perceived as well as small details of light and dark thus jpeg is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans if you plan to machine analyze your images the small errors introduced by jpeg may be a problem for you even if they are invisible to the eye a useful property of jpeg is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters this means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality you can make extremely small files if you don t mind poor quality this is useful for indexing image archives making thumbnail views or icons etc etc conversely if you aren t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied and accept lesser compression two why use jpeg there are two good reasons to make your image files smaller and to store two four bit per pixel color data instead of eight bit per pixel data making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images being able to compress a two mbyte full color file down to one zero zero kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time if you are comparing gif and jpeg the size ratio is more like four to one more details below if your viewing software doesn t support jpeg directly you ll have to convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images even with a jpeg capable viewer it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format gif for instance thus using jpeg is essentially a time space tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply it s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file i ll let you do the arithmetic yourself the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet posting format is that jpeg can store full color information two four bits pixel one six million colors instead of eight or less two five six or fewer colors if you have only eight bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you within a couple of years though eight bit gif will look as obsolete as black and white macpaint format does today furthermore for reasons detailed in section seven jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware hence jpeg is considerably more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard three when should i use jpeg and when should i stick with gif jpeg is not going to displace gif entirely for some types of images gif is superior in image quality file size or both one of the first things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to as a rule of thumb jpeg is superior to gif for storing full color or gray scale images of realistic scenes that means scanned photographs and similar material jpeg is superior even if you don t have two four bit display hardware and it is a lot superior if you do see section seven for details gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors such as cartoons and line drawings in particular large areas of pixels that are all exactly the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by gif jpeg can t squeeze these files as much as gif does without introducing visible defects this sort of image is best kept in gif form in particular single color borders are quite cheap in gif files but they should be avoided in jpeg files jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges a row of pure black pixels adjacent to a row of pure white pixels for example sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting again this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs but it shows up fairly often in gif files borders overlaid text etc the blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that s only a few pixels high if you have a gif with a lot of small size overlaid text don t jpeg it computer drawn images ray traced scenes for instance usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity the more complex and subtly rendered the image the more likely that jpeg will do well on it the same goes for semi realistic artwork fantasy drawings and such plain black and white two level images should never be converted to jpeg you need at least about one six gray levels before jpeg is useful for gray scale images it should also be noted that gif is lossless for gray scale images of up to two five six levels while jpeg is not if you have an existing library of gif images you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg you will lose a little image quality if you do section seven which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif only applies if both formats start from a full color original if you start from a gif you ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information jpeg can only make things worse however the disk space savings may justify converting anyway this is a decision you ll have to make for yourself if you do convert a gif library to jpeg see section one four for hints be prepared to leave some images in gif format since some gifs will not convert well four how well does jpeg compress images pretty darn well here are some sample file sizes for an image i have handy a seven two seven x five two five full color image of a ship in a harbor the first three files are for comparison purposes the rest were created with the free jpeg software described in section six b file size in bytes comments ship ppm one one four five zero four zero original file in ppm format no compression two four bits or three bytes per pixel plus a few bytes overhead ship ppm z nine six three eight two nine ppm file passed through unix compress compress doesn t accomplish a lot you ll note other text oriented compressors give similar results ship gif two four zero four three eight converted to gif with ppmquant fs two five six ppmtogif most of the savings is the result of losing color info gif saves eight bits pixel not two four see sec seven ship jpg nine five one five five six two two cjpeg q nine five highest useful quality setting this is indistinguishable from the two four bit original at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs ship jpg seven five five eight zero zero nine cjpeg q seven five default setting you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this from the original even with both on screen at once ship jpg five zero three eight four zero six cjpeg q five zero this has slight defects if you know what to look for you could tell it s been jpeged without seeing the original still as good image quality as many recent postings in usenet pictures groups ship jpg two five two five one nine two cjpeg q two five jpeg s characteristic blockiness becomes apparent at this setting djpeg blocksmooth helps some still i ve seen plenty of usenet postings that were of poorer image quality than this ship jpg five o six five eight seven cjpeg q five optimize optimize cuts table overhead blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or indexing purposes note that this file is tiny the compression ratio from the original is one seven three one in this case jpeg can make a file that s a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of comparable quality the q seven five file is every bit as good as the gif better if you have a full color display this seems to be a typical ratio for real world scenes five what are good quality settings for jpeg most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting there seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings quality nine five does not mean keep nine five of the information as some have claimed the quality scale is purely arbitrary it s not a percentage of anything the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting smallest file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here are some rules of thumb the default quality setting q seven five is very often the best choice this setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image try q seven five first if you see defects then go up except for experimental purposes never go above q nine five saying q one zero zero will produce a file two or three times as large as q nine five but of hardly any better quality if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to q five zero without objectionable degradation on the other hand you might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg the default q seven five is about right for compressing two four bit images but q eight five to nine five is usually better for converting gifs see section one four for more info if you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purposes and are prepared to tolerate large defects a q setting in the range of five to one zero is about right q two or so may be amusing as op art note the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section six b and to many programs based on it other jpeg implementations such as image alchemy may use a completely different quality scale some programs don t even provide a numeric scale just high medium low style choices six where can i get jpeg software most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp if you don t know how to use ftp see the faq article how to find sources if you don t have direct access to ftp read about ftpmail servers in the same article that article appears regularly in news answers or you can get it by sending e mail to mail server rtfm mit edu with send usenet news answers finding sources in the body the anonymous ftp list faq may also be helpful it s usenet news answers ftp list faq in the news answers archive note this list changes constantly if you have a copy more than a couple months old get the latest jpeg faq from the news answers archive six a if you are looking for canned software viewers etc the first part of this list is system specific programs that only run on one kind of system if you don t see what you want for your machine check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over internet but some commercial programs are listed too x windows xv shareware two five is an excellent viewer for jpeg gif and many other image formats it can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations it s available for ftp from export lcs mit edu one eight two four zero one two file contrib xv three zero zero tar z version three zero zero is a major upgrade with support for two four bit displays and many other improvements however it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking if you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge stick with version two two one also available from export note that version two two one is not a good choice if you have a two four bit display you ll get only eight bit color nor for converting two four bit images to jpeg but two two one works fine for converting gif and other eight bit images to jpeg caution there is a glitch in version two two one be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when saving a jpeg file or the file will be blurry another good choice for x windows is john cristy s free imagemagick package also available from export lcs mit edu file contrib imagemagick tar z this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks the imagemagick viewer handles two four bit displays correctly for colormapped displays it does better though slower color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software both of the above are large complex packages if you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest release three zero three xloadimage is free and available from export lcs mit edu file contrib xloadimage three zero three tar z xli is a variant version of xloadimage said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to jpeg files because it has the ijg v four decoder while xloadimage three zero three is using a hacked over v one the next xloadimage release will fix this xli is also free and available from export lcs mit edu file contrib xli one one four tar z both programs are said to do the right thing with two four bit displays ms dos this covers plain dos for windows or os two programs see the next headings one good choice is eric praetzel s free dvpeg which views jpeg and gif files the current version two five is available by ftp from sunee uwaterloo ca one two nine nine seven five zero five zero file pub jpeg viewers dvpeg two five zip this is a good basic viewer that works on either two eight six or three eight six four eight six machines the user interface is not flashy but it s functional another freeware jpeg gif tga viewer is mohammad rezaei s hiview the current version one two is available from simtel two zero and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics hv one two zip hiview requires a three eight six or better cpu and a vcpi compatible memory manager qemm three eight six and three eight six max work windows and os two do not hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen for larger images it scales the image down to fit on the screen rather than using panning scrolling as most viewers do you may or may not prefer this approach but there s no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably note installation is a bit tricky read the directions carefully a shareware alternative is colorview for dos three zero this is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives its user interface is also much spiffier looking although personally i find it harder to use more keystrokes inconsistent behavior it is faster than dvpeg but a little slower than hiview at least on my hardware for images larger than screen size dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed and both are faster than hiview the current version is two one available from simtel two zero and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics dcview two one zip requires a vesa graphics driver if you don t have one look in vesadrv two zip or vesa tsr zip from the same directory many recent pcs have a built in vesa driver so don t try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains that the driver is missing a second shareware alternative is fullview which has been kicking around the net for a while but i don t know any stable archive location for it the current rather old version is inferior to the above viewers anyway the author tells me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the simtel two zero archives at that time the well known gif viewer compushow cshow supports jpeg in its latest revision eight six zero a however cshow s jpeg implementation isn t very good it s slow about half the speed of the above viewers and image quality is poor except on hi color displays too bad it d have been nice to see a good jpeg capability in cshow shareware two five available from simtel two zero and mirror sites see note below file msdos gif cshw eight six zero a zip due to the remarkable variety of pc graphics hardware any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine if you can t get any of them to work you ll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert jpeg to gif then view with your favorite gif viewer if you have hi color hardware don t use gif as the intermediate format try to find a targa capable viewer instead vpic five zero is reputed to do the right thing with hi color displays the independent jpeg group s free jpeg converters are ftpable from simtel two zero and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics jpeg four zip or jpeg four three eight six zip if you have a three eight six and extended memory these files are dos compilations of the free source code described in section six b they will convert jpeg to and from gif targa and ppm formats handmade software offers free jpeg gif conversion tools gif two jpg jpg two gif these are slow and are limited to conversion to and from gif format in particular you can t get two four bit color output from a jpeg the major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write hsi s proprietary jpeg format as well as the usenet standard jfif format since hsi format files are rather widespread on bbses this is a useful capability version two zero of these tools is free prior versions were shareware get it from simtel two zero and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics gif two jpg two zip note do not use hsi format for files to be posted on internet since it is not readable on non pc platforms handmade software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package image alchemy this will translate jpeg files both jfif and hsi formats to and from many other image formats it can also display images a demo version of image alchemy version one six two is available from simtel two zero and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics alch one six two zip note about simtel two zero the internet s key archive site for pc related programs is simtel two zero full name wsmr simtel two zero army mil one nine two eight eight one one zero two zero simtel two zero runs a non unix system with weird directory names where this document refers to directory eg msdos graphics at simtel two zero that really means pd one if you are not physically on milnet you should expect rather slow ftp transfer rates from simtel two zero there are several internet sites that maintain copies mirrors of the simtel two zero archives most ftp users should go to one of the mirror sites instead a popular usa mirror site is oak oakland edu one four one two one zero one zero one one seven which keeps simtel two zero files in eg pub msdos graphics if you have no ftp capability you can retrieve files from simtel two zero by e mail see informational postings in comp archives msdos announce to find out how if you are outside the usa consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest simtel two zero mirror is microsoft windows there are several windows programs capable of displaying jpeg images windows viewers are generally slower than dos viewers on the same hardware due to windows system overhead note that you can run the dos conversion programs described above inside a windows dos window the newest entry is winecj which is free and extremely fast version one zero is available from ftp rahul net file pub bryanw pc jpeg wecj zip requires windows three one and two five six or more colors mode this is a no frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers but it s so fast you ll use it anyway at least for previewing jview is freeware fairly fast has good on line help and can write out the decompressed image in windows bmp format but it can t create new jpeg files and it doesn t view gifs jview also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers such as brightness adjustment but it s an excellent basic viewer the current version zero nine is available from ftp cica indiana edu one two nine seven nine two zero eight four file pub pc win three desktop jview zero nine zero zip mirrors of this archive can be found at some other internet sites including wuarchive wustl edu winjpeg shareware two zero displays jpeg gif targa tiff and bmp image files it can write all of these formats too so it can be used as a converter it has some other nifty features including color balance adjustment and slideshow the current version is two one available from simtel two zero and mirror sites see note above file msdos windows three winjp two one zero zip this is a slow two eight six compatible version if you register you ll get the three eight six only version which is roughly two five faster colorview is another shareware entry three zero this was an early and promising contender but it has not been updated in some time and at this point it has no real advantages over winjpeg if you want to try it anyway the current version is zero nine seven available from ftp cica indiana edu file pub pc win three desktop cview zero nine seven zip i understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with colorview for dos dvpeg see dos heading also works under windows but only in full screen mode not in a window os two the

two programs has image manipulation so you need to have quicktime installed to use quicktime you need a six eight zero two zero or better cpu and you need to be running system six zero seven or later if you re running system six you must also install the three two bit quickdraw extension this is built in on system seven you can get quicktime by ftp from ftp apple com file dts mac quicktime quicktime hqx as of one one nine two this file contains quicktime one five which is better than qt one zero in several ways with respect to jpeg it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg file however some applications seem to have compatibility problems with qt one five mac users should keep in mind that quicktime s jpeg format pict jpeg is not the same as the usenet standard jfif jpeg format see section one zero for details if you post images on usenet make sure they are in jfif format most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format the first choice is probably jpegview a free program for viewing images that are in jfif format pict jpeg format or gif format it also can convert between the two jpeg formats the current version two zero is a big improvement over prior versions get it from sumex aim stanford edu three six four four zero six file info mac app jpeg view two zero hqx requires system seven and quicktime on eight bit displays jpegview usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewers jpegview can view large images in much less memory than other mac viewers in fact it s the only one that can deal with jpeg images much over six four zero x four eight zero pixels on a typical four mb mac given a large image jpegview automatically scales it down to fit on the screen rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers you can zoom in on any desired portion though some people like this behavior some don t overall jpegview s user interface is very well thought out gifconverter a shareware four zero image viewer converter supports jfif and pict jpeg as well as gif and several other image formats the latest version is two three two get it from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac art gif gif converter two three two hqx requires system six zero five or later gifconverter is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeg gif viewer but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images also the newest version of gifconverter can load and save jfif images without quicktime so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run quicktime but it s faster with quicktime note if gifconverter runs out of memory trying to load a large jpeg try converting the file to gif with jpeg convert then viewing the gif version jpeg convert a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utilities is available from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac app jpeg convert one zero hqx this will run on any mac but it only does file conversion not viewing you can use it in conjunction with any gif viewer previous versions of this faq recommended imagery jpeg v zero six a jpeg gif converter based on an old version of the ijg code if you are using this program you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert apple s free program pictpixie can view images in jfif quicktime jpeg and gif format and can convert between these formats you can get pictpixie from ftp apple com file dts mac quicktime qt one zero stuff pictpixie hqx requires quicktime pictpixie was intended as a developer s tool and it s really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a two four bit display and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface worse pictpixie is an unsupported program meaning it has some minor bugs that apple does not intend to fix there is an old version of pictpixie called pictcompressor floating around the net if you have this you should trash it as it s even buggier also the quicktime starter kit includes a much cleaned up descendant of pictpixie called picture compressor note that picture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the net storm technology s picture decompress is a free jpeg viewer converter this rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways but it will run without system seven or quicktime so you may be forced to use it on older systems it does need three two bit quickdraw so really old machines can t use it you can get it from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac app picture decompress two zero one hqx you must set the file type of a downloaded image file to jpeg to allow picture decompress to open it if your machine is too old to run three two bit quickdraw a mac plus for instance gifconverter is your only choice for single program jpeg viewing if you don t want to pay for gifconverter use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer more and more commercial mac applications are supporting jpeg although not all can deal with the usenet standard jfif format adobe photoshop version two zero one or later can read and write jfif format jpeg files use the jpeg plug in from the acquire menu you

next both are currently being re organized so it s hard to point to specific sub directories note that there is an older version floating around that does not support jpeg portable software for almost any system if none of the above fits your situation you can obtain and compile the free jpeg conversion software described in six b you ll also need a viewer program if your display is eight bits or less any gif viewer will do fine if you have a display with more color capability try to find a viewer that can read targa or ppm two four bit image files there are numerous commercial jpeg offerings with more popping up every day i recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow in that case purchase a hardware assisted product ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final jpeg standard and about whether it can handle the jfif file format many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else s files six b if you are looking for source code to work with free portable c code for jpeg compression is available from the independent jpeg group which i

see the faq article how to find sources referred to at the top of section six the free jpeg code provides conversion between jpeg jfif format and image files in gif pbmplus ppm pgm utah rle and truevision targa file formats the core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs such as image viewers the package is highly portable we have tested it on many machines ranging from pcs to crays we have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use companies are welcome to use it as the basis for jpeg related products we do not ask a royalty although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature see the readme file in the distribution for details we hope to make this software industrial quality although as with anything that s free we offer no warranty and accept no liability the independent jpeg group is a volunteer organization if you d like to contribute to improving our software you are welcome to join seven what s all this hoopla about color quantization most people don t have full color two four bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware stores eight or fewer bits per pixel so it can display two five six or fewer distinct colors at a time to display a full color image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors this process is called color quantization this is something of a misnomer color selection would be a better term we re stuck with the standard usage though clearly color quantization is a lossy process it turns out that for most images the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg except at the very lowest jpeg quality settings since jpeg is a full color format converting a color jpeg image for display on eight bit or less hardware requires color quantization this is true for all color jpegs even if you feed a two five six or less color gif into jpeg what comes out of the decompressor is not two five six colors but thousands of colors this happens because jpeg s lossiness affects each pixel a little differently so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors each original color gets smeared into a group of nearby colors therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display regardless of the image source the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray scale output incidentally because of this effect it s nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a jpeg image even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values different jpeg decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences i occasionally see posted images described as two five six color jpeg this tells me that the poster a hasn t read this faq and b probably converted the jpeg from a gif jpegs can be classified as color or gray scale just like photographs but number of colors just isn t a useful concept for jpeg on the other hand a gif image by definition has already been quantized to two five six or fewer colors a gif does have a definite number of colors in its palette and the format doesn t allow more than two five six palette entries for purposes of usenet picture distribution gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization so recipients don t have to this is also the disadvantage of gif you re stuck with the sender s quantization if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display you have to re quantize resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full color image furthermore if the sender didn t use a high quality color quantization algorithm you re out of luck for this reason jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don t match the sender s display hardware jpeg s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user s display hardware furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms there is a lot of active research in this area or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of jpeg images you already have with a gif you re stuck forevermore with what was sent it s also worth mentioning that many gif viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines if you view a two five six color gif on a one six color ega display for example you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations one to create the gif one to display it but often it s also due to sloppiness jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed thus jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average gif program for low color resolution displays as well as high resolution ones finally an ever growing number of people have better than eight bit display hardware already one five bit hi color pc displays true two four bit displays on workstations and macintoshes etc for these people gif is already obsolete as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively thus jpeg is an all around better choice than gif for representing images in a machine independent fashion eight how does jpeg work the buzz words to know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and huffman or arithmetic entropy coding this article s long enough already so i m not going to say more than that here for technical information see the comp compression faq this is available from the news answers archive at rtfm mit edu in files pub usenet news answers compression faq part one three if you need help in using the news answers archive see the top of this article nine what about lossless jpeg there s a great deal of confusion on this subject the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm i e one that guarantees the final output is bit for bit identical to the original input however this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular lossy jpeg algorithm and it offers much less compression at present very few implementations of lossless jpeg exist and all of them are commercial saying q one zero zero to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step with the v four free jpeg code you can also say sample one x one to turn off subsampling keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value it s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image at this minimum loss setting regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed two four bit per pixel image true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantees bit for bit accuracy if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than six bits per pixel per color component you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard this performs better than jpeg lossless on such images jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with six or more bits per pixel furthermore jpeg is public domain at least with a huffman back end while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents one zero why all the argument about file formats strictly speaking jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms it does not refer to a specific image file format the jpeg committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations since we can t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leaves us with a problem in the absence of official standards a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to do their own thing and as a result their programs aren t compatible with anybody else s the closest thing we have to a de facto standard jpeg format is some work that s been coordinated by people at c cube microsystems they have defined two jpeg based file formats jfif jpeg file interchange format a low end format that transports pixels and not much else tiff jpeg aka tiff six zero an extension of the aldus tiff format tiff is a high end format that will let you record just about everything you ever wanted to know about an image and a lot more besides tiff is a lot more complex than jfif and may well prove less transportable because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different and incompatible subsets of tiff it s not likely that adding jpeg to the mix will do anything to improve this situation both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of jpeg related products it s reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in picture postings jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now the tiff six zero spec has only recently been officially adopted and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details even when tiff jpeg is well defined the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common denominator tiff jpeg files may never be as transportable a particular case that people may be interested in is apple s quicktime software for the macintosh quicktime uses a jfif compatible format wrapped inside the mac specific pict structure conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward and several mac programs are available to do it see mac portion of section six a if you have an editor that handles binary files you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand see section one one for details another particular case is handmade software s programs gif two jpg jpg two gif and image alchemy these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif format by default though they write a proprietary format developed by hsi this format is not readable by any non hsi programs and should not be used for usenet postings use the j switch to get jfif output this applies to old versions of these programs the current releases emit jfif format by default you still should be careful not to post hsi format files unless you want to get flamed by people on non pc platforms one one how do i recognize which file format i have and what do i do about it if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software won t read it s likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpeg based format you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file one a jfif standard file will start with the characters hex ff d eight ff e zero followed by two variable bytes often hex zero zero one zero followed by jfif two if you see ff d eight at the start but not the rest of it you may have a raw jpeg file this is probably decodable as is by jfif software it s worth a try anyway three hsi files start with hsi one you re out of luck unless you have hsi software portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data but they won t decompress properly with non hsi programs four a macintosh pict file if jpeg compressed will have a couple hundred bytes of header followed by a jfif header scan for jfif strip off everything before the ff d eight and you should be able to read it five anything else it s a proprietary format or not jpeg at all if you are lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream look for ff d eight try stripping off everything before that in uuencoded usenet postings the characteristic jfif pattern is begin line m c x whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with begin line m i if you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non jfif files one two what about arithmetic coding the jpeg spec defines two different back end modules for the final output of compressed data either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed the choice has no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file on typical images arithmetic coding produces a file five or one zero percent smaller than huffman coding all the file size numbers previously cited are for huffman coding unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm at the space savings isn t great enough to justify the potential legal hassles in particular arithmetic coding should not be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future stay tuned for further details one three does loss accumulate with repeated compression decompression it would be nice if having compressed an image with jpeg you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially unfortunately this is not the case in general recompressing an altered image loses more information though usually not as much as was lost the first time around the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it without changing it then there is no further loss i e you get an identical jpeg file even this is not true at least not with the current free jpeg software it s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error if you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first generation output it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change one of the things on our to do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited but i am not optimistic about it in any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full color output of djpeg at the original quality setting would introduce no further loss even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff error degradation if you re wondering why it s because the pixel block boundaries move if you cropped off only multiples of one six pixels you might be safe but that s a mighty limited capability the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images but you don t want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps use a lossless format ppm rle tiff etc while working on the image then jpeg it when you are ready to file it away aside from avoiding degradation you will save a lot of compression decompression time this way one four what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg as stated earlier you will lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to jpeg if you can obtain the original full color data the gif was made from it s far better to make a jpeg from that but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg to make sure you are happy with it before throwing away the corresponding gif that will give you a chance to re do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary some gifs may be better left as gifs as explained in section three in particular cartoon type gifs with sixteen or fewer colors don t convert well you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be larger than the gif so check the sizes too experience to date suggests that large high visual quality gifs are the best candidates for conversion to jpeg they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings and they convert to jpeg with least degradation don t waste your time converting any gif much under one zero zero kbytes also don t expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created directly from full color originals to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight through jpeg files would be i e shoot for one two or one three rd the size of the gif file not one four th as suggested in earlier comparisons many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant color border around a gif image while useless this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in gif files it is not free in jpeg files and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ghost edges do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging if you are on an x windows system xv s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this cjpeg s default q setting of seven five is appropriate for full color input but for gif inputs q settings of eight five to nine five often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation if you apply smoothing as suggested below the higher q setting may not be necessary color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool your eye into seeing more than the two five six colors that gif can actually store if you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value the trouble with dithering is that to jpeg it looks like high spatial frequency color noise and jpeg can t compress noise very well the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image if you had it to get around this you want to smooth the gif image before compression smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q factor thus further reducing the size of the compressed file while still obtaining a better looking output image than you d get without smoothing with the v four free jpeg software or products based on it a simple smoothing capability is built in try smooth one zero or so when converting gifs values of one zero to two five seem to work well for high quality gifs heavy handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors if you can see regular fine scale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement then strong smoothing is definitely called for too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image which you don t want if you are an image processing wizard you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program such as pnmconvol from the pbmplus package however cjpeg s built in smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol the upshot of all this is that cjpeg quality eight five smooth one zero is probably a good starting point for converting gifs but if you really care about the image you ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings for more information about jpeg in general or the free jpeg software in particular contact the independent jpeg group at jpeg

 from einkauf austin ibm com mark einkauf subject re need help z buffering lines areas together originator mark einkauf austin ibm com organization ibm austin keywords z buffer roundoff lines areas lines one zero five david gorgen writes i m asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low apparent precision in z buffering that i ve encountered in two different pex implementations i can t find any discussion of this problem in any resources i can lay hands on e g the comp windows x pex faq gaskins s pexlib programming manual vendors documentation the problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize stitching artifacts resulting from the use of z buffering with polylines that are coplanar with filled areas the interpolated z values along a line will differ slightly due to roundoff error from the interpolated z values across an area even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with vertices of the area because of this it s a tossup whether the z buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed visually the result tends to be a dashed line effect even though the line is supposed to be solid using the pexlib api my approach to a solution is to use two slightly different pex view mapping transforms in two view table entries one for the areas and one for the lines the pex structures or immediate mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in effect for areas and the other is always in effect for lines the result is a slight shift in npc z coordinates for the lines so as to attempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines this shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used in the pexlib view table entry for lines just a hair backwards i e smaller vrc z coordinates compared to their positions in the view table entry used for areas this means that when a point is transformed to npc its z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than if it comes from an area thus accomplishing the desired bias i would expect the z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount to a few units at most out of the entire dynamic range of the z buffer typically from zero to six five five three five if not one six seven seven seven two one five i e one six or two four bit z buffers therefore it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of z in vrc between the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix the stitching but in fact experience shows that the shift has to be as much as zero zero zero three to zero zero zero six of the range empirically it s worst when the npc z component of the slope of the surface is high i e when it appears more or less edge on to the viewer it s as if only eight or nine bits of the z buffer have any dependable meaning this amount is so great that one problem is replaced by another sometimes the polylines show through areas which they are supposed to lie behind i ve observed the problem on both hewlett packard and digital workstation pex servers to approximately the same degree the test program demonstrates the problem on an mit pexlib five x implementation this version is known to compile and run on an hp ux system with pex five one open questions one why does this happen am i configuring the pex view table wrongly is there a systematic difference in z interpolation for lines as opposed to areas e g pixel centers versus corners which could be corrected for are pex implementors wantonly discarding z precision in their interpolators something else two what to do about it can i fix my use of the view table to allow better precision in z buffered hlhsr is there another approach i can take to remove the stitching artifacts am i just out of luck we here at ibm have the same problem with our workstations i was also shocked when i first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by about one six bits assuming two four bit z buffer this seems huge but is only one two five six of the dynamic range in those terms it doesn t seem so bad what is happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear due mainly to roundoff i believe so the polygon is not planar in z but is more like a ruffles potato chip ditto with lines when you start end at different x y values the ridges are out of phase resulting in the stitch effect you have the same problem if you try to draw one polygon right on top of another but with different vertices you will likely see a smeared effect where they overlap example try polygon one one zero zero one zero zero one zero zero one zero zero two zero zero one zero zero two zero zero two zero zero one zero zero two zero zero one zero zero one zero zero polygon two one two five one two five one zero zero one two five one seven five one zero zero one seven five one seven five one zero zero one seven five one two five one zero zero your implementation is correct in fact we do a similar trick when rendering primitives that have lines and polygons such as nurbs surfaces with isoparametric lines without the trick the lines appear stitched as you say when the application draws lines polygons independently the system does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting so the application must do it this is what you have discovered and are doing bravo note to ibm ers the information given here has been previously disclosed

 from pstlb aurora alaska edu subject where did the hacker ethic go lines four six nntp posting host acad three alaska edu organization university of alaska fairbanks a great many computer programmers read dr dobb s journal in a recent issue there was a paragraph in an article that pained me greatly to read it said there s nothing wrong if microsoft setting the standards for the computer industry the industry needs an ibm for the nine zero s where has the hacker ethic gone not the cracker ethic which is something entirely different and bad but the hacker ethic which tells us to value the free distribution of information and yield to the hands on imperative why is it that people and corporations like bill gates ibm and intel are able to have a virtual dead lock on the computer industry why is it that if a person like myself posts messages to usenet on how to get into the little nooks crannies and idiosyncrasies of a computer system they are not given any useful information by those who know just a badmouthing or are completely ignored why is it that people like steve jobs have to abandon their efforts to make truly innovative products i ask those of you who call yourselves hackers why is this and further how can you let it go on it is a fact that the computer industry has changed the world and shall continue to do so for a long time to come it has allowed the propagation of information in a volume unheard of even twenty years ago and has made this world even smaller than it was before i shudder to think what that world will be like if the corporations are allowed to have their way perpetuating more drivel like the two eight six windows and the ibm product line on the computer using public that is not to say i am against business per se people who profit off of innovative intelligent creative designs do not bother me in fact i applaud it that is the american way but those who manage to sell kludgy uncreative systems to the public and profit off of them are the ones who are the problem and unfortunately because they have enough money to make up for blunt stupidity they can keep doing it for a very long time i put it to you thus where has the hacker ethic gone if it still exists where and if it does exist why are those who call themselves hackers allowing this to perpetuate itself why are they not creating new innovative interesting ideas to stop the sos from maintaining its choke hold on the computer industry i await with interest what will probably be a resounding silence pstlb acad three alaska edu revenge is a dish best served cold szechuan death khan singh star trek ii the wrath of khan

 from lilley v five cgu mcc ac uk chris lilley subject oh make up your mind was re xv problems lines two two zero reply to c c lilley mcc ac uk organization computer graphics unit mcc in article jk eight seven three seven seven lehtori cc tut fi kouhia juhana writes in article c c lilley mcc ac uk writes in article jk eight seven three seven seven lehtori cc tut fi kouhia juhana writes i wrote something about making color modifications quickly with eight bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the two four bit image this makes sense because the main use of xv is only viewing images doing many changes to image we should keep all modifications in a buffer and then before making the operations to two four bit image we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations think about what you are saying here the two four bit image is quantised down to eight bits so many similar colours are mapped onto a single palette colour this colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways you then want to apply these modifications back to the two four bit file so you have to find which colours mapped to this one palette colour i suppose you don t know what about we have discussed we discussed about error s in xv two two one which shows images only as eight bit and my suggestion above works perfectly with it look be consistent first you post something that seems to suggest that you see xv being an eight bit program as some sort of error so i post and asy it is not a bug it is meant to be like that so you post and say it is not a bug you never said it was i have misunderstood etc now you are saying we discussed about error s in xv two two one which shows images only as eight bit if you would make up your mind what you are claiming it would make the discussion a lot easier so far i have seen a colormap editing window in xv that is there must be a colormap anyway the problems you present are exist anyway and i didn t tried to solve them at all because i would not make such problems to my programs in the first place eh sorry i don t understand what you are saying here i am aware that english is not your native language and have tried hard to fathom your meaning but this paragraph defeats me gamma and color corrections are easily done to two four bit image as i presented there s no need make tricks from eight bit quantized image back to two four bit image yes as i originally said global changes are easily possible but this statement contradicts what you said earlier i wrote something about making color modifications quickly with eight bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the two four bit image how would you suggest doing colour editing on a two four bit file how would you group related colours to edit them together only global changes could be done unless the software were very different and much more complicated ok you re writing about situation that user want edit images as two four bit and user want edit individual colors your questions by the way jumps off the discussion a bit no i don t think so actually you were talking about loading a two four bit image into xv by quantising manipulating the colours in the colour editor then somewhow applying these changes to the two four bit file when you exit xv xv lets you edit individual colours where is this sudden jumping off the topic my solution doesn t work because there s no colormap withing real two four bit image yes i am aware there is no colourmap in a two four bit file you see user see two four bit image going back to eight bit is silly i do not understand what this statement is supposed to mean about changing individual colors in eight bit quantized rasterized image changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most cases if the image is quantized and rasterized small change may make serious errors to anywhere in the image what are you saying xv allows this feature but i don t recommend to use it with the mentioned type images ah now we see thew problem first you want to extend xv to allow editing of eight bit previews of two four bit images then i point out problems with this now you are saying there is no problem because you personally happen not to use those parts of the program that cause the problem moreover xv is not a paint program you can only make those global changes not sure what you are saying here certainly one can make local changes in full two four bit xv changing individual colors sounds like paint program job if person have eight bit screen there s need for tricks to get the original two four bit image modified because user don t see full two four bit image there s need to make approximations and it is not possible to modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups if image is rasterized to select indiavidual color there could be seven x seven cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area selecting individual color is possible from that yes that is one possible approach i would find a program that took such an approach clumsy however ok i don t have thought very much two four bit painting programs never seen such in good view and are not planned to make such not to mention two four bit painting program in eight bit screen well here we agree you have not thought it through very much you don t seem to have a consistent point to make and contradict yourself from one post to the next ok we all have off days perhaps you should step back and think this one through yes again what is was wrong with xv it saved eight bit quantized rasterized images as two four bit jpegs jpeg is not designed for that as i said in the last post jpeg is a compression algorithm it is a way of saving disk space by trading off quality against compression i fail to see what the problem is you have not proposed any workable alternatives also human expect that two four bit will be saved as two four bit image speak for yourself you are the only person i have met or spoken to who having quantised a two four bit image down to eight bits expects this process to somehow reverse when the file is saved keeping all modificvations that heve been made to the eight bit image palette perhaps that is why you yused the singular say person would like to crop part of the image and save it then it is expected that the image still is the same look next time you import a two four bit image into xv look carefully at the main control panel it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the eight bit image xv makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original two four bit file you are the only person who claims this is confusing so xv were designed without thinking about human interface and how human expect the program work design error is a design error the same as a bug read my lips xv is a program for viewing and modifying eight bit images it lets you import other images it shows i would say a good deal of thought about the human interface and everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it was designed for it makes no false claims i have heard xv were designed first for eight bit images files but it were not good idea to take full two four bit images without making major change to the original design if you would come up with a solid logical well argued and lucid description of precisely how these proposed extensions would work feel free to post them so far you have not done so so even all screen images are eight bit the processed images and saved images could have been two four bit very easily instead of eight bit argh after all this a comment like that very easily ok go ahead and code it if it is so easy or alternatively look up the terms import and non reversible transformation before anybody will make a note yes i may as well make a lift where up means that the lift goes down and down means that the lift goes up and put a note on this design solution to the manuals however even the manuals tells the correct situation it doesn t solve the problem americans the lift is just an example i think this is a bit of an exageration what you are actually saying is you got into a lift elevator if you are in the states and mistakenly pressed the down button to go up everyone else had no problem now you are trying to sue the manufacturer well my text may be a bit hard reading you bet hopefully you suggeeded to read it mostly leaving aside the language issue however it

 from ldo waikato ac nz lawrence d oliveiro waikato university subject quicktime performance was re rumours about three do organization university of waikato hamilton new zealand lines six seven ok with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with quicktime the effects of scaling and so on i thought i d do some more tests first of all i felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than realistic the movie i had been using only had one eight frames in it it was a version of the very first movie i created with the compact video compressor i decided something a little longer would give closer to real world results for better or for worse i pulled out a copy of two zero zero one a space odyssey that i had recorded off tv a while back about fifteen minutes into the movie there s a sequence where the earth shuttle is approaching the space station specifically i digitized a portion of about three zero seconds duration zooming in on the rotating space station i figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between frames to increase the differences between frames i digitized it at only five frames per second to give a total of one seven one frames i captured the raw footage at a resolution of three eight four two eight eight pixels with the spigot card in my centris six five zero quarter size resolution from a pal source i then imported it into premiere and put it through the compact video compressor keeping the five fps frame rate i created two versions of the movie one scaled to three two zero two four zero resolution the other at one six zero one two zero resolution i used the default two zero zero quality setting in premiere two zero one and specified a key frame every ten frames i then ran the three two zero two four zero movie through the same raw speed test program i used for the results i d been reporting earlier result a playback rate of over four five frames per second that s right i was getting a much higher result than with that first short test movie just for fun i copied the three two zero two four zero movie to my external hard disk a quantum lp one zero five s and ran it from there this time the playback rate was only about three five frames per second obviously the two three zero mb internal hard disk also a quantum is a significant contributor to the speed of playback i modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional scaling factors and tried playing back the one six zero one two zero movie scaled to three two zero two four zero size this time the playback speed was over six zero fps clearly the poster who observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing quicktime one zero in action not one five i d try my tests with quicktime one zero but i don t think it s entirely compatible with my centris and system seven one unscaled the playback rate for the one six zero one two zero movie was over one zero zero fps the other thing i tried was saving versions of the three two zero two four zero movie with preferred playback rates greater than one zero and seeing how well they played from within movieplayer ie with quicktime s normal synchronized playback a preferred rate of nine zero four five fps didn t work too well the playback was very jerky compare this with the raw speed test which achieved four five fps with ease i can t believe that quicktime s synchronization code would add this much overhead i think the slowdown was coming from the mac system s task switching a preferred rate of seven zero three five fps seemed to work fine i couldn t see any evidence of stutter at eight zero four zero fps i think i could see slight stutter but with four key frames every second it was hard to tell i guess i could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the key frames to make the stutter more noticeable of course this will also improve the compression slightly which should speed up the playback performance even more lawrence d oliveiro fone six four seven eight five six two eight eight nine computer services dept fax six four seven eight three eight four zero six six university of waikato electric mail ldo waikato ac nz hamilton new zealand three seven four seven two six s one seven five one nine seven e gmt one two zero zero

 from ttknock santafe edu boss hogg subject pov animating organization the santa fe institute lines two zero nntp posting host sanjuan santafe ede x newsreader tin version one one pl eight in an attempt to do animation with pov i have created two little programs one is a c program that will perform a morph between any two points given the amount of frames for the morph and then it will write the points and the function translate rotate etc out to a file then i have a perl script that will read the list of functions and insert them into a pov file at a given line i had hoped this would let me do simple animation however i have discovered that simply performing incremental rotations on an object will not spin a stationary object but will actually rotate the object about the axis now i know an easy way around this would be to first translate the object to the origin perform the rotation and then move it back but i know there must be another way around this i had thought perhaps it was because i had created objects at the origin and then translated them to a new point and then done the rotation which could cause this behavior however this occurs on objects that are not translated at all any help is appreciated ttknock bbs santafe edu
