 from dps nasa kodak com dan schaertel subject re homosexuality issues in christianity reply to dps nasa kodak com organization eastman kodak company lines two zero in article two eight three two eight athos rutgers edu carlson ab two four larc nasa gov ann carlson writes anyone who thinks being gay and christianity are not compatible should check out dignity integrity more light presbyterian churches affirmation mcc churches etc meet some gay christians find out who they are pray with them discuss scripture with them and only then form your opinion if you were to start your own religion this would be fine but there is no scriptural basis for your statement in fact it really gets to the heart of the problem you think you know more than scripture your faith is driven by feel goodism and not by the word of god just because they are nice people doesn t make it right you can start all the churches you want and it won t change the fact that it is wrong that is not to imply that gays don t deserve the same love and forgiveness that anyone else does but to call their behavior right just because they are nice people is baseless and it offers satan a perfect place to work because there is no check on what he is doing i suspect ann was suggesting that you look to see whether the spirit is alive among them not whether they are nice people though there s something to be said for being nice too clh
