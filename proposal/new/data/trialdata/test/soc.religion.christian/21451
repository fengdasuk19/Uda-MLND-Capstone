 from nabil cae wisc edu nabil ayoub subject re monophysites and mike walker organization u of wisconsin madison college of engineering lines four seven in article our moderator comments chalcedon was a compromise between two groups the alexandrians and antiochenes it adopted language that was intended to be acceptable to moderates in both camps while ruling out the extremes i agree that there were extremes that were heretical however in the course of the complex politics of the time it appears that some people got rejected who didn t intend heresy but simply used language that was not understood or even was mispresented and some seem not to have jointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine there are groups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps this posting discussed the descendants of the alexandrians there are also a remaining nestorians like some of the current so called monophysites there is reason to believe that the current so called nestorians are not heretical either they sheltered nestorius from what they saw as unfair treatment but claim they did not adopt his heresies and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of the antiochene tradition clh there is a big difference between the status of what you refer to as alexandrians actually this includes all oriental orthodox churches and not only copts and that of nestorians the oriental orthodox churches never even shelter eutyches the advocator of monophysitism but on the contrary it condemned and still does condemn him and his heresy that is why the eastren chalcedonian orthodox church held talks with the oriental non chalcedonian that started three zero years ago and still continueing till today but they have converged on many issues the most imporatant of which is christology i have more details of the inter orthodox dialogue in case anyone is interested so i do not see how the alexandrians and the nestorians are in a similar position peace nabil nabil ayoub engine research center dept of mechanical engineering university of wisconsin madison email ayoub erctitan me wisc edu
