 from rexlex fnnews fnal gov subject arsenokoitai four organization fnal lines two five eight continuing part four i think used by permission the source and nt meaning of arsenokoitai with implications for christian ethics and ministry james b deyoung w petersen more recently wright s understanding has itself been questioned from a different direction in a brief one nine eight six study william petersen found linguistic confusion in using the english word homosexuals as the meaning of arsenokoitai two two he faulted wright and english bible translaions for rendering it by homosexuals in i cor six nine and i tim one one zero in a sense petersen has coalesced bailey boswell and scroggs into a single assertion that reiterates in effect the position of bailey he finds homosexuals unacceptable as a translation because it is anachronistic a major disjunction exists between contemporary thought and terminology and the thought and terminolgy in paul s time one eight seven eight eight what is this disjunction he bases it on historical and linguistic facts accordingly ancient greek and roman society treated male sexuality as polyvalent and characterized a person sexually only by his sexual acts virtually all forms of behavior except transvestism were acceptable christianity simply added the categories of natural and unnatural in describing these actions ancient society know nothing of the categories of homosexuals and heterosexuals and assumed that in the words of dover quoted approvingly by petersen everyone responds at different times to both homosexual and to heterosexual stimuli one eight eight two three in contrast to this modern usage virtually limits the term homosexual to desire and propensity k m benkert who in one eight six nine coined the german term equivalent to homosexual used it as referring to orientation impluse or affectional preference and having nothing to do with sexual acts one eight nine petersen then proceeds to cite the supplement to the oxford english dictionary which defines homosexual only as a propensity or desire with no mention of acts petersen s point is that by using homosexuals for arsenokoitai one wrongfully reads a modern concept back into early history where no equivalent concept existed one eight nine consequently the translation is inaccurate because it includes celibate homophiles incorrectly exludes heterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts andincorrectly includes female homosexuals one nine eight nine prior to one eight six nine there was no cognitive structure either inour society or in antiquity within which the modern bifurcation of humanity into homosexuals and hetersosexuals made sence one eight nine the foregoing clarifies why petersen feels that the translatio homosexual is mistaken yet is it possible that petersen is the one mistaken on both historical and linguistic or philological grounds the next phases of this paper will critically examine petersen s position the justification for translating arsenokoitai by homosexuals historical grounds a refutation of the foregoing opposition to the traslation of arsenokoitai by homosexuals begins with the historical and cultural evidence since virtually everyone acknowledges that the word does not appear before paul s usage no historical settings earlier than his are available yet much writing reveals that ancient understanding of homosexuality prior to and contemporary with paul the goal is to discover wheither the ancient s conceived of homosexuality particularly homosexual orientation in a way similar to present day concepts peterson bailey boswell and scroggs claim that the homosexual condition desire propensity or inversion whatever it is called cannot be part of the definition of the term they assert this either because the term is limited to acts of particular kind boswell active male prostitutes scroggs pederasty or because the homosexual condition was unknown in ancient times bailey petersen the following discussion will show why neither of these positions is legitimate attention will be devoted to the latter postion first with the former one being addressed below under linguistic grounds in regard to the latter position one may rightfully ask did not the homosexual condition exist before one eight six nine is it only a modern phenomenon yet if it is universal as alleged today it must have existed always including ancient times even though there is lack of sophistication in discussing it indeed evidence show that the ancients pre christian and christian not only knew about the total spectrum of sexual behavior including all forms of same sex activity transvestism included but also knoew about same sex orientation or condition petersen admits one nine zero n one zero that plato in symposium one eight nine d one nine two d may be a sole possible exception to ancient ingnorance of this condition he discounts this however believing that even here acts appear to be the deciding factor however this is a very significant exception hardly worthy of being called an exception because of the following additional evidence for a homosexual condition the symposium of plato gives some of the strongest evidence for knowledge about the homosexual condition two four plato posits a third sex comprised of a maile female androgynon man woman hence original nature palai physis consisted of three kinds of human beings zeus sliced these human beings in half to weaken them so that they would not be a threat to the gods consequently each person seeks his or her other half either one of the opposite sex or one of the same sex plato then quotes aristophances each of us then is but a tally of a man since every one shows like a flatfish the traces of having been sliced in two and each is ever searching for the tally that will fit him all the men who are sections of that composite sex that at first was called man woman are woman courters our adulterers are mostly descended from that sex whence likewise are derived our mancourting women and adulteresses all the women who are sections of the woman have no great fancy for men they are incllined rather to women and of this stock are the she minions men who are sections of the male pursue the masculine and so long as their boyhood lasts they show themselves to be sliced of the male by making griends with men and delighting to lie with them and to be clasped in men s embrasces these are the finest boys and striplings for they have the most manly nature some say they are shameless creatures but falsely for their behavior is due not to shamelessness but to daring manliness and virility since they are quick to welcome their like sure evidence of this is the fact that on reaching maturity these alone prove in a public career to be men so when they come to man s estate they are boy lovers and have no natural interest in wiving and getting children but only do these things under stress of custom they are quite contented to live together unwedded all their days a man of this sort is at any rate born to be a lover of boys or the willing mate of a man eagerly greeting his own kind well when one of them whether he be a boy lover or a lover of any other sort happens on his own particular half the two of them are wondrously thrilled with affection and intimacy and love and are hardly to be induced to leave each other s side for a single moment these are they who continue together throughout life though they could not even say what they would have of one another one nine one d one nine two c two five should these two persons be offered the opportunity to be fused together for as long as they live or even in hades aristophanes says that each would unreservedly deem that he had

zero one c desire is felt for what is not provided or present for something they have not or are not or lack this is the object of desire and love socrates clearly distinguishes between what sort of being is love and the works of love two zero one e this ancient philosopher could think of both realms seaual acts as well as disposition of being or nature his wors have significance for more than pederasty two six in summary virtually every element in the modern discussion of love and homosexuality is anticipated in the symposium of plato petersen is in error when he claims that the ancients could only think of homosexual acts not inclination or orientation widespread evidence to the contray supports the latter two seven biblical support for homosexuality inclination in the contexts where homosexual acts are discribed adds to the case for the ancient distinction in rom one two one two eight such phrases as reasoning heart becoming foolish desires of the heart and reprobate mind prove paul s concern for disposition and inclination along with the doing or working of evil also see vv two nine three two even the catologues of vices are introdiced i tim one eight one zero or concluded
