 from mls panix com michael siemon subject re arsenokoitai nt meaning of organization panix public access internet stipulating paul s intent the immediate question is how can his readers understand this intent and following on that question there is a second one what is our proper action if we do manage to understand him since paul gives not a single clue about his meaning in the text of one st corinthians there are two positive answers and one negative to this question a paul or apollos or someone in the apostolic community has conveyed to the corinthians the then traditional jewish condem nation of homosexual behavior and paul expects them to be sufficiently well tutored by this tradition that he needs no futher explanation i should note that there is no evidence in the letter or in two corinthians for such a supposition b the spirit will teach us what paul means or if not paul what god means behind paul s inspired word choice c we don t know and cannot guess to within any better pre cision here than for comparison in the parallel use by paul in the same passage of the word pleonektai those who have more if you think that areseonkoitai is obvious from its roots try cutting your teeth on this word the neb translates it as grabbers or even methusoi drunkards at least this has the advantage of being a common insult so that at least there is some hint as to its meaning the three positions more or less if i can be allowed some exaggeration for the sake of argument define a classical catholic attitude towards tradition one form of protestant sola scriptura and a liberal critical demand for evidence all three positions have strengths and weaknesses ad a it is unquestionable that the gospel was preached in and by the community of christ s disciples and their successors and that our nt scripture itself emerges from this communal tradition but it s also the case that we know little or nothing about this tradition until almost a century after paul which is to say that we have access to the tradition only after several generations of possibly confused transmission the scripture is itself our only documentation of the tradition in the critical era ad b if we are not born of water and spirit to revert to john in an attempt to explain paul then we have no more hope of under standing the gospel than nicodemus had neither the traditions of men nor the vain elevation of our own reason can prevent the spirit from blowing where it will the paraclete is a kamikaze but the downside of protestant belief in the efficacy of the spirit as our guide in scripture is that the wing of protestantism that takes this most seriously is also the most fragmented over divergent understanding supposedly derived from the clear word of god note classical lutheran calvinist and anglican thought constrains scripture to be read within tradition even while reserving judgment against tradition out of scripture the more bizarre forms of i will read scripture my way are primarily a fringe aspect of cultic protestantism the main problem with this approach is that there is apparently no means for one person to convey to another what that one may feel is teaching received from the spirit and history shows incredible conflict between christians on this point each in his own mind convinced that he is led by the spirit no one can seriously urge point b without some sense of its potential for setting christian against christian to what purpose ad c the critical approach has the distinct advantage that when it can reach a conclusion it can lay out the data in a way which is open to all the weakness is an obvious corollary this is not usually possible if i may say a word here out of my own already acknowledged bias one complaint against critical methodology is that it dissolves faith but surely a faith that cannot honestly face the evalu ation of evidence has problems which mere theology is helpless to address anyway there is a serious and unfortunate possibility of schism between liberal and conservative positions mostly on the basis of extreme zealots of positions b and c a catholic sense of authority and tradition tends to constrain arguments of b contra c to secondary position so that despite horrendous strains rome is not as likely to find these issues as ultimately divisive as the protestant world will and anglicans will i predict muddle through on the via media attempting to give each position its due but no more than its due second question suppose tradition tells us and lots of spiritual christians tell us and critical thought at least admits as possible that paul is refering to a flat universal levitical prohibition against male male sex what then again we can abdicate our personal responsi bility to tradition and let it dictate the answer but it s precisely where inherited traditions are not questioned that they re most dangerous we have examples of christ questioning the pharisees and their use of tradition despite his urging in matthew two three two that we are to heed them we have examples of peter and more radically still paul jettisoning the traditions that they were led by the spirit to call into question jesus and peter and paul do not so much throw out tradition as subject it to radical criticism on a couple of very basic grounds the weightier demands of the law justice and mercy and good faith matthew two three two three and on these two commandments love god but if it does in fact come from god you will not only be unable to destroy them but you might find yourselves fighting against god acts five three six three nine all i ask is that you listen to your traditions and read your scriptures with a mind and soul open to the spirit and to the past history of our first christian witnesses willingness to challenge tradition and other readings of scripture though read with all the authority of scribes and rabbis and a submission to the declaration that all must depend on the love of god and neighbor then study the evidence learn the history of christians oppressing christians out of their traditions and eagerness to judge where jesus and paul tell us not to judge and let the witness of the spirit in the lives of your fellow christians including those who are not of your preference in theology guide you towards god s truth michael l siemon i say you are gods sons of the mls panix com most high all of you nevertheless or you shall die like men and fall mls ulysses att com like any prince psalm eight two six seven there s a certain ambiguity in your discussion of position a as to whether you re speaking of tradition in paul s time or ours i think there are two ways to use tradition one is to say that when paul and his readers share a tradition it makes sense to interpret his words in the context of that shared tradition that s what makes me think that these arguments over words turn out to be silly we know that paul came out of a background that was rather puritanical on sex everything else he says on sex is consistent with that background the tone of his remarks on homosexuality in rom one is consistent with that background even if the words in the sin lists aren t the most general terms for homosexual activity and it seems to me that there s some evidence that they are not they are just one more piece of evidence for something we would probably be willing to believe with no evidence at all that paul shares the common jewish rejection of homosexuality but when you identify a with the catholic position that s rather a horse of a different color the catholic position involves a continuing church tradition arguments specific to that tradition might be one we can get guidance on how to interpret paul s original meaning from tradition e g the way the church fathers interpreted him and two we gain confidence that his prohibitions still apply in our time because of the universal judgement of the church between his time and ours i think this is a somewhat different use of tradition a radical protestant might be willing to use known one st cent tradition to illuminate paul s original meaning but not use the catholic position to answer the question of what our own attitude to homosexuality should be clh
