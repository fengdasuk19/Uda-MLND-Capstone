 from mail server mozart cc iup edu mserv subject ten commandments or ten discourses lines one three five in the course of discussing the sabbath with some folks i came across something that was completely new to me and i thought i d offer it for comment to keep this as brief as possible let me state my observation as a declarative statement and then whoever wants to can comment on it basically what i think i ve observed is that the phrase the ten commandments as used by moses is not a reference to ex two zero one one seven but rather a reference to ten distinct discourses from ex two zero one through ex three one one eight that is the phrase the ten commandments should more accurately be translated the ten discourses of which the passage we call the ten commandments is really only the first i m not completely convinced that the above is true but for purposes of discussion let me argue it as though i was sure arguments supporting the above idea one there aren t really ten commandments in ex two zero one one seven in order to get one zero commandments you have to get two of them out of verses three six and the verses themselves do not support such a division because they are all about not worshipping other gods that is verse three commands to have no other gods and verse five commands to not worship the idols mentioned in verse four you can t violate verses five six without violating verse three indicating that the whole passage is one command and leaving us with only nine commandments i could go on at length about this but for now i ll just stop with this summary two there are ten speeches between ex two zero one the beginning of the traditional ten commandments and ex three one one eight where god actually gives moses the two tablets with the ten commandments discourses written on them i break these ten down as follows two zero one one seven two zero two two two six two one one two three three three two five one three zero one zero three zero one one one six three zero one seven two one three zero two two three three three zero three four three eight three one one one one and three one one two one eight in most cases each of these passages begins with some variation of the phrase and the lord spoke to moses saying the exception is ex two one one which begins now these are the ordinances which you are to set before them three the word translated commandments in the phrase the ten commandments isn t really the word for commandment its the word for a speech or an utterance it s a word often used for longer discourses rather than individual statements for instance when combined with the word yom day this word is translated chronicles in such phrases as now the rest of the acts of so and so are they not written in the chronicles of x the word for commandment is freely used throughout the books of moses and perhaps it is significant that when moses spoke of the ten x s he appears to have avoided the word for commandment and chosen instead a word associated with discourses longer than just a single command four god tells moses that he is going to give him the stone tablets with the law and the commandments ex two four one two yet he does not give moses the tablets until he has finished all ten discourses on mount sinai if the ten commandments were only ex two zero one one seven it is not immediately clear why god would wait several days and nine more discourses before giving these tablets to moses on the other hand if we have the ten discourses written on the tablets then it makes perfect sense that god would not give moses the tablets until he had finished delivering all ten discourses five when moses did get the tablets he found that both tablets were written on both sides ex three two one five if these ten commandments were only the first one seven verses of ex two zero god would have had to have written in large letters not that he couldn t have of course but it does seem more likely to me that this is a reference to two tablets containing ten discourses written in normal sized letters six in ii cor three paul seems to specifically single out the commandments written on stone as being the ministry of death that which is fading away and the ministry of condemnation with the possible exception of the commandment about the sabbath it is difficult to see why paul would refer to the commands in ex two zero one one seven as being temporary fading away type commandments this is less of a problem if the stone tablets should happen to have included all of the commandments from ex two zero through ex three one arguments against this idea the main argument against this idea aside from the fact that it contradicts a long standing tradition is that in dt five two two moses says after quoting the commands in ex two zero one one seven these words the lord spoke and he added no more and he wrote them on two tablets of stone and gave them to me this appears to identify the words just quoted as being the only contents of the two stone tablets that was my first impression anyway however after some thought i noted that a great deal hinges on how you understand the phrase these words if moses meant these words which i have just related to you were spoken by god etc then that would mean that only the traditional ten commandments were on the stone tablets if however moses was making a parenthetical comment these words which i am now telling you were spoken by god etc then that s quite different i did note that in the dt five account moses tells of being given the stone tablets before telling of the people asking moses to represent them before god whereas in the exodus account the people asked this of moses between the first and second discourses several days before god gave moses the stone tablets this reinforces the idea that moses remarks in dt five two two ff were intended as a parenthetical remark rather than a strictly chronological account of when god wrote what and at what point he stopped adding to what was on the tablets summary all things considered i find it somewhat more likely that the nine commands in ex two zero are really only the first of what moses regarded as the ten discourses of god i don t know if anybody has ever espoused this idea before it s brand new to me so while i lean towards accepting it i would be very interested in hearing any comments and criticisms anyone may care to offer mark
