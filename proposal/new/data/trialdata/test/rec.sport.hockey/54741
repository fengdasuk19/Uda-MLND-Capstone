 from sclark epas utoronto ca susan clark subject re leafs what happened organization university of toronto epas nntp posting host epas utoronto ca lines four zero hi guys what happened one potvin didn t let six goals by two wendel and andreychuk woke up three home ice and lots of yelling in the gardens gave the leafs the emotional edge four refs calls especially last night tended to favour leafs a couple of comments one on gilmour just because the guy isn t one of the three stars doesn t mean he was not leading the team someone posted the playoff point total and he s in something like fifth or sixth place plus he walked away with the molson cup given for accumulating points from the three star selection during the regular season two on the officiating i ve heard gripes from both ends on this one emotions are very high in this series the rivalry is one of the stronger ones i know of i do have to agree that the officiating last night was pro leaf in general except for whoever missed that slash on gilmour s hand three in general i still think detroit has one of the better chances vs pittsburgh though i think the leafs would do better against the blues but not as well if they made it out of the division problem is i like both these teams though i m supporting the leafs on the underdog principle d by the way gilmour tiring out is a lot like bob probert not playing aggressive hockey by the way i m not any sort of expert nor do i claim to be i just like watching a good matchup tee hee hee ooops susan
