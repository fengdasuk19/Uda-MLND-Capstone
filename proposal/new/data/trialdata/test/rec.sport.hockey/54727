 subject flames final stats and playoff news from caldwell eight one zero two mtroyal ab ca organization mount royal college calgary alberta lines one one eight news for the first time all season the flames are now injury free the only player remaining on the limp is center carey wilson who even when healthy is not a major part of the team trent yawney did not score a goal all season until the last regular season game against san jose he potted his first of the year in that game and has also scored goals in both game one and game two against los angeles thoughts on game one the flames played horribly in dropping the first game of their series with los angeles six three on sunday afternoon they seemed more interested in throwing big hits than in scoring goals they physically dominated the kings but that was the only area they dominated in the game plan was to rush the net and try and take advantage of a young inexperienced l a defence and the shaky kings goaltending but those plans fell by the wayside while the flames conducted a steady march to the penalty box particularily stupid was theoren fleury taking a five minute major and a game misconduct for slamming warren rychel s face into the dasher while rychel was on his knees goaltender mike vernon played well and could not really be faulted for the loss despite his well publicized poor record in afternoon games he got very little support from his defence in clearing the front of the net and sweeping away rebounds in fact marty mcsorley s goal actually went in off chris dahlquist s skate in front of the net thoughts on game two the flames came back strong in the second game evidently aware of the potentially fatal consequences of losing both the first two games on home ice the first period was fairly even with the edge going to the kings but calgary came out strong in the second period and simply dominated the kings scoring five goals to take a lead they never relinquished en route to a nine four win the deciding factors in this game were faceoffs and special teams calgary dominated on faceoffs as they did in game one but they were able to make better use of the won faceoffs in this game than they did in the first one calgary also went three for five on the powerplay while l a only went one for eight and gave up a shorthanded goal to joel otto l a s powerplay goal also came late in the game with the outcome already decided the kings powerplay failed them when they needed it most in the one st and two nd periods the flames lost rw greg paslawski with a suspected shoulder injury when he was leveled by alexei zhitnik right after scoring calgary s seven th goal charlie huddy left the game for the kings with a groin injury the game was marred by stupidity in the last minute first craig berube of calgary took a five minute major for fighting plus a game misconduct for instigating when he went after tony granato for no apparent reason granato drew a minor for some strange reason turtling perhaps this was followed three zero seconds later by warren rychel drawing a major minor and game misconduct for hitting frank musil in the face with his stick and then instigating a fight musil got a fighting major for some similarily strange reason hardy and yawney went toe to toe and both got double minors gregson thought that musil turtling amounted to fighting but that yawney and hardy throwing punches at each other was just roughing where s this guy from upcoming games friday april two three at l a sunday april two five at l a tuesday april two seven home to l a thursday
