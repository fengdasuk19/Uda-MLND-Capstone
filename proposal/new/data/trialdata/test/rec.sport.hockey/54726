 from anna matyas subject re pens fans reactions organization h ss dean s office carnegie mellon pittsburgh pa lines four one nntp posting host po three andrew cmu edu in reply to susan dart writes amongst penguins fans there seems to be an inner calm that i ve never experienced before this year with the pens the players and the fans have so much confidence in the team this year we re savoring every game and saving our energy for the stanley cup that s a good way to put it it s a quiet confidence i don t feel like i have to defend this team anymore the devils are a puzzle to me they have long been one of the few teams i always dreaded playing their d isn t quite what it used to be but they still usually play us pretty tough i just can t figure it out at least last night they mounted an attack two watching some of the devils players being interviewed i could see in their faces and eyes that they really don t have any confidence they are left speechless when asked what more they can to do to beat the pens they act as though they know it s a hopeless task bernie nichols was interviewed after game two on the late news he was shaking his head in disbelief over barrasso saying that tommy is like another defenseman out there and how difficult it is playing against him then he got this far away look on his face his voice started trailing off and he said it just isn t right it just isn t fair and he tried to muster a smile i m really impressed with bowman s coaching tactics he s had an answer for every move that brooks has thrown at the pens as far as coaching goes a pens islanders match up should be pretty good one guy i feel sorry for in all of this so far is chris terreri i m sure tom barrasso knows how he feels for so long tommy would look up and not have a teammate in sight terreri s teammates really left him out in the cold in the first two games mom
