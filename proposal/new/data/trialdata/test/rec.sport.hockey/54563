 from leunggm odin control utoronto ca gary leung subject fuhr deserves credit was sabres sweep fuhr s role organization university of toronto systems control group lines four six in article lzuo byron u washington edu joseph writes in article randolin polisci umn edu robert andolina writes many people have suggested that fuhr s play is the only reason that the sabres beat the bruins while fuhr was a critical factor i would not overlook the fact that the sabres finally got some scoring from people other than mogilny and lafontaine khmylev sweeney hawerchuck etc indeed lafontaine played hurt and didn t score many goals also the team played better defense although not great than in the regular season fuhr deserves a lot of credit but not all of it robert a i agree with this i also think fuhr s contribution for sabres s win is just the same as many palyers in the team mogilny had six goals in four games including two goals for the great comeback in the final win after fuhr had left the key for sabres s win over boston is whole team s strong commitment as an underdog and all their talent players including mogilny and fuhr i think that grant fuhr deserves more credit than that while it s true that the entire sabres team played very well i still believe that if it wasn t for grant fuhr the series would now be tied two two he virtually stole games one and three for the sabres in both of these games fuhr stood on his head to give the sabres the chance to win especially in game three fuhr made a series of huge stops in the third period when the score was tied two two even in game two when the sabres won four zero the score seemed to indicate that the sabres dominated however if it hadn t been for fuhr the sabres wouldn t have been up two zero i think it was through the two nd period and the bruins wouldn t have had to open up the game thereby allowing mogilny to score the third goal on a breakaway to salt away the game there is no doubt in my mind that fuhr was the critical factor in the victory in my opinion neely oates and juneau played as well as lafontaine mogilny and hawerchuk the sabres did get extraordinary efforts from hannan sweeney wood and khmylev compared to that of the bruins checkers however the bruins defense imo played better than the sabres defense the sabres have ken sutton playing a regular shift afterall the difference in the series was fuhr who outplayed andy moog gary go sabres
