two min switzerland beat sweden in a wc for the first time since one nine five zero and the swiss now have a small chance of reaching the quarterfinals if austria beats italy tonight the swiss took the lead after hakan ahlund made an incredibly stupid drop pass at his own blue line and celio came in alone with soderstrom and beat tommy to the stick side the swedes continued to make mistakes as howald was allowed to skate in between the swedish d and put the puck past tommy to make it zero two zero three was a nice one howald entered the swedish zone slammed on the breaks and his shot went in by tommy s far post one of the lousiest periods i ve seen sweden play this year second period saw a new swedish team and the swiss had to ice the puck many times on a pp nylander skated in from the boards pavoni made the initial save but peter andersson scored on the rebound then a power play goal from the swiss a slap shot from the blue line hit two players on the way to the goal and past soderstrom also jonas bergqvist made it two four after a nice pass from naslund behind the goal jan larsson reduced the lead to three four just before the end of two nd period on a pp skated in unattacked in front of the goal and put the puck through pavoni s five hole third period sweden equalized on a slap shot from renberg that trickled through pavoni s five hole then another defensive mistake by the swedes waeger was allowed to skate around the swedish goal unattacked and from close range could make it four five hollenstein then scored four six on a two on one break away and put it

eight six zero zero russia probably made their best game of the tourney but yet there wasn t enough to win against the effective canadians galley took a slap shot that found dineen by the far post and dineen just deflected the puck past trefilov in the russian goal then a power play goal after a couple of deflections eric lindros found kariya alone by the far post and kariya put the puck high over a sliding trefilov russia won the shots in the first period one two five and they had the most of the scoring opportunities but they just couldn t score second period saw lindros scoring his one zero th goal of the wc kariya entered the russian zone slammed on the break to get past his defenseman then made a nice pass to corson who just got the stick on the puck to deflect it to lindros who one timed the puck the russians then finally got their goal karpov broke in from the side and made a slap shot in tugnutt s top right hand corner player of the game in canada was voted paul kariya and for russia valeri karpov i agree the difference in this game was lindros and kariya and in part also tugnutt kariya had a far better game now than vs the swedes and he was very impressive kariya got the place in the line with lindros after mike gartner went out with a rib injury early in the first period lindros btw lead the point scoring with one four pts nine five before this game seven pts ahead of the next player i e double as much as the next player among those kariya with one six amazing group b results finland czech republic one three zero zero one one zero two one st two nd cze zero one
