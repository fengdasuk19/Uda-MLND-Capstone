 from c four four five five eight five mizzou one missouri edu john kelsey subject how to make the clipper chip and wiretapping less bad nntp posting host mizzou one missouri edu organization university of missouri lines one five i ve got an idea that would remove most of the political complaints i have about the clipper chip pass a law stating that if within a year of performaing a wiretap on someone a police agency hasn t managed to convict the suspect of the crime the warrant wiretap was for then that agency owes the suspect one million to repay him her for lost privacy of course there are still problems with the technical aspects of clipper and with the one size fits all mentality that would be behind an attempt to enforce it as a standard but this would be a way for those in favor of allowing continued wiretaps to assure us that it will only be used in cases where the crime is important and the police are all but certain that there really will be a conviction john kj elsey
