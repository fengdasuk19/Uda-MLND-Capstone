 from schneier chinet chi il us bruce schneier subject re crypto papers on the net organization chinet public access unix lines three four in article c four four five five eight five mizzou one missouri edu john kelsey writes i ve recently been reading a paper of merkle s publixhed only on the net i think discussing three potential replacements for des was anyting ever done with these are khufu khafre and or snefru still being discussed anywhere i know snefru is referenced in the rsa faq and i think it may also be in the sci crypt faq on a related topic can anyone point me toward good sites to find papers articles discussions of cryptology i think i ve about exhausted the math sci library here which doesn t seem to have anything more recent than about eight four thanks john kelsey khufu and khafre are both patented five zero zero three five nine seven biham and shamir showed that differential cryptanalysis can break one six round khafre with a chosen plaintext attack using one five zero zero different encryptions khafre with two four rounds can be broken with the same attack using two five three different encryptions there are probably more efficient differential cryptanalytic attacks if someone wants to take the time to look khufu has key dependent s boxes and is immune to differential cryptanalysis source code for this algorithm and khafre are in the patent snefru is a public domain one way hash function the version of snefru that produces a one two eight bit hash is vulnerable to differential cryptanalysis vulnerable means that the attack is more efficient that brute force for four passes or less given that sha and md five are much more efficient oh yes anyone interested in licensing the patent should contact dave petre director of patent licencing for xerox two zero three nine eight six three two three one bruce
