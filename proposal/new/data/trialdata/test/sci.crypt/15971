 from hal cco caltech edu hal finney subject re let s build software cryptophones for over the internet organization california institute of technology pasadena lines two six nntp posting host alumni caltech edu gtoal gtoal com graham toal writes i forwarded an old posting about celp speech compression i ve since been told that the source of this is on cygnus com in pub celp speech tar z i m not in a position to any sun tcp ip gurus out there who think they can marry this with netfone by the end of the week seriously i think someone with real net access and two sparcs could have this running by the end of the week then we ask the pgp guys to add a bytestream crypto filter two weeks at the most damn i wish i had my sparc back i m stuck on a two five mhz three eight six sx i tried this code yesterday on my sparcstation elc it takes over three zero zero seconds to compress two two seconds worth of speech this means that it needs to be optimized by over a factor of one zero before it will be usable in even a half duplex mode i question whether celp is the best approach for this application it produces great compression but at the expense of tremendous cpu loads we want something that can be run on ordinary workstations or even high end pc s without dsp cards my guess is that some other algorithm is going to be a better starting point hal finney
