 from graham toal subject re let s build software cryptophones for over the internet originator gtoal pizzabox demon co uk nntp posting host pizzabox demon co uk reply to graham toal organization cuddlehogs anonymous lines two one in article hal cco caltech edu hal finney writes i tried this code yesterday on my sparcstation elc it takes over three zero zero seconds to compress two two seconds worth of speech this means that it needs to be optimized by over a factor of one zero before it will be usable in even a half duplex mode ouch thanks for trying it i question whether celp is the best approach for this application it produces great compression but at the expense of tremendous cpu loads we want something that can be run on ordinary workstations or even high end pc s without dsp cards my guess is that some other algorithm is going to be a better starting point yes i m not sure if my xposting to comp speech made it to here too but i ve found that a low sample rate three three zero zero samples sec at eight bits per sample plus the pd shorten lossless sound compression code actually does get speech into one four four k with a simdgen left over this is definitely worth working on folks and shorten works in well under real time g
