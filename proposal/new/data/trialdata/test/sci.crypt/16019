 from patl golem mit edu patrick j lopresti subject re s one s two organization massachvsetts institvte of technology lines three two nntp posting host golem mit edu in reply to steve b access digex com s message of two two apr one nine nine three zero seven five two four six zero four zero zero in article steve b access digex com steve brinich writes second question why why is such a strange procedure used and not a real rng this turns those s one s two in a kind of bottleneck for system security the only theory that makes any sense is that s one and s two are either the same for all chips or vary among very few possibilities so that anyone trying to break the encryption by brute force need only plow through the possible serial numbers two three zero about one billion multiplied by the number of different s one s two combinations suppose instead that s one and s two can be reconstructed given three or four of the unit keys generated in a single batch through some sort of known plaintext attack say suppose further that three or four of the chips programmed in each session never find their way into commercial products but instead end up elsewhere suppose the folks at elsewhere can determine a unit key given physical access to one of these chips then those same folks can determine s one and s two for the whole batch too many suppositions yeah probably pat
