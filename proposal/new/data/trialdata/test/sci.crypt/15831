 from dougb comm mot com doug bank subject re revised technical summary of clipper chip reply to dougb ecs comm mot com organization motorola land mobile products sector nntp posting host one four five one one four six three five lines five three in article denning guvax acc georgetown edu writes the chips are programmed by mykotronx inc which calls them the myk seven eight the silicon is supplied by vlsi technology inc they are implemented in one micron technology and will initially sell for about three zero each in quantities of one zero zero zero zero or more the price should drop as the technology is shrunk to eight micron hmmmmmm three zero seems a bit expensive how big is the chip what kind of packages will be used three volt or five volt technology how much current will it draw i think there are many practical questions that haven t been answered especially since this chip already exists all clipper chips are programmed inside a scif secure compartmented information facility which is essentially a vault the scif contains a laptop computer and equipment to program the chips about three zero zero chips are programmed during a single session the scif is located at mykotronx at the beginning of a session a trusted agent from each of the two key escrow agencies enters the vault agent one enters a secret random eight zero bit value s one into the laptop and agent two enters a secret random eight zero bit value s two these random values serve as seeds to generate unit keys for a sequence of serial numbers thus the unit keys are a function of one six zero secret random bits where each agent knows only eight zero ok i ve got a big problem with all of this how in the world do you expect to sell these chips for even three zero after all the overhead involved in this programming procedure two four people a laptop only three zero zero chips at a time give me a break and how long does all of this take even if it is a minute per chip it will take the greater part of a day to turn out three zero zero of these things how long do you suppose it will take to program those one zero zero zero zero chips mentioned above this is highly impractical to see how the chip is used imagine that it is embedded in the at t telephone security device as it will be suppose i call someone and we both have such a device after pushing a button to start a secure conversation my security device will negotiate an eight zero bit session key k with the device at the other end so where can i find info on this at t device what kind of vocoder does it use does it require isdn phone lines if not is it full duplex how does it sound what kind of synchronization scheme is used will all other little black boxes have to conform to at ts choices of protocol etc will anybody else be allowed to build boxes that conform to these specifications doug bank private systems division dougb ecs comm mot com motorola communications sector dougb nwu edu schaumburg illinois dougb casbah acns nwu edu seven zero eight five seven six eight two zero seven
