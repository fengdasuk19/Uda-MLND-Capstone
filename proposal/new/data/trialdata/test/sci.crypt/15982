 from mjr tis com marcus j ranum subject re let s build software cryptophones for over the internet organization trusted information systems inc lines four eight nntp posting host sol tis com graham toal writes yes i m not sure if my xposting to comp speech made it to here too but i ve found that a low sample rate three three zero zero samples sec at eight bits per sample plus the pd shorten lossless sound compression code actually does get speech into one four four k with a simdgen left over this is definitely worth working on folks and shorten works in well under real time i don t think that this should be worked on just in the context of cryptography that s sure to pose all sorts of problems for all sorts of people what s needed is for someone to develop a portable telephone quality speech rs two three two converter imagine if you will a little box that takes data on its serial port and puts out sound and takes sound and codes it to signals on its serial port full duplex now this device is not a cryptographic device it s a portable poor man s sound blaster or whatever you want to call it it s got loads of perfectly legitimate applications for a speech synthesis with a few nifty libraries and some samples b speech recording for electronic messaging c building voicemail systems d internet talk radio e internet relay chat of course some of the electronic messaging in item b might be encrypted possibly realtime but that s the user s decision one would need two of these talky boxes and a pair of modems and some kind of cutout to switch over and some code on say a four eight six laptop i d really like to see such a thing developed so that interactive internet talk radio could be done ideally though it should be a general purpose device it should be a general purpose enough device that nobody should be able to balk at its widespread use obviously to make it easy for homebrewers it should use pretty common hardware it s interesting to note that i d already talked with a couple of folks about building such a thing before this whole clipper thing started i even went so far as to track down a couple of folks who are able to make sample units given incentive and some time i d envisioned finding a couple of folks interested in such a project and helping fund development of a public domain board layout and parts set that could be published in the form of cad drawings for a couple of major cad packages and in postscript anyone interested i ll start a provisional mailing list let me know if you want on mjr
