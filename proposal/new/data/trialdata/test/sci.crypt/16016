 from tarnold vnet ibm com todd w arnold subject re how sensible is des towards bit errors organization ibm cryptographic facility development disclaimer this posting represents the poster s views not those of ibm news software ureply three one lines one five in axel dunkel writes how sensible is des encrypted data towards bit errors how much data per bit will be lost in average i assume you still have the correct key it depends on the mode you re using for a single six four bit input block a one bit error will have a five zero percent chance of corrupting each of the six four output bits in other words it essentially turns the output block into a random number if you re encrypting data in cbc mode however only the one six four bit block will be affected the next block and all that follow it will be decrypted properly it s a good idea to have some kind of error correction in your system if corrupted bits are likely todd
