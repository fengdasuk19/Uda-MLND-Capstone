 from t three one six nine four c kaira hut fi tapani lindgren subject re des salts nntp posting host kaira hut fi organization helsinki university of technology finland lines two one in article mikel demax com mikel lechner writes you could just as well use a one six character password to perform the encryption of the six four zero bits one simple method would be to use the first eight characters to encrypt the six four zero bits and then use the remaining eight characters to encrypt the result again the output would still be six four bits which encodes into one one ascii characters wouldn t this method be vulnerable against a birthday attack currently a cracker needs to find the only one key that produces the given ciphertext he has to try about two six three keys on the average in the proposed method the cracker only needs any pair of key halves if he can store about two three two guesses for one half he is likely to find a mathching pair in about two three two guesses here i have assumed that the des encryption is reversable if the key is guessed is this so or do the modifications of the s boxes by the salt bits make it non reversable one probably there is only one key i think there is one chance in about one two eight that there are two or more keys can anyone verify this but this doesn t help the cracker much
