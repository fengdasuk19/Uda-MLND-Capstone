 from c four four five five eight five mizzou one missouri edu john kelsey subject re clipper considered harmful nntp posting host mizzou one missouri edu organization university of missouri lines three two the clipper chip s user key is formed by r one eden one s one s two s one r two eden two s one s two s one r three eden three s one s two s one why is the triple encrytion used is it just to gain an effective increase in keyspace to defeat a potential keysearch if so why use eight zero bit keys not knowing anything about the skipjack algorithm it s not really possible to guess whether this makes it harder or easier to guess s one s two why are n one n two and n three formed as they are it would be facinating to see the skipjack algorithm to look for ways of attacking it that require three ciphertext blocks formed in that odd way where do the three four bit constant values that are concatenated with the serial number to form n one n two n three come from are they changed from chip to chip or session to session even if they re published in the ny times if skipjack is resistant to known plaintext attacks when using triple encryption then there s no break in security but why allow that kind of weird format if those three three four bit values are truly random bits then maybe it s used to ensure that a known plaintext attack on skipjack if it exists can t be easily used to derive s one and s two for a whole production run of these chips does dorothy denning read this group if not is someone on the group forwarding questions like these to her or martin hellman or anyone else who s seen more details about the chip john kelsey
