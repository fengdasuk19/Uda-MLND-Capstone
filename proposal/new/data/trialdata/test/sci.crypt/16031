 from rbrand usasoc soc mil raymond s brand subject re clipper considered harmful organization sofnet lines one three two in article smb research att com steven bellovin writes there are three issues with clipper the first is whether or not the architecture of the whole scheme is capable of working my answer with one significant exception is yes i really do think that nsa and nist have designed this scheme about as well as can be assuming that their real objectives are as stated to permit wiretapping under certain carefully controlled circumstances with a minimum risk of abuse the exception is that u exists outside of the chip on a programming diskette that s seriously wrong u one and u two should be loaded onto the chip separately to those who disagree and i don t claim my answer is obvious though i found my own reasoning sufficiently persuasive that i was forced to rewrite the conclusions section of my technical analysis paper i had originally blasted the scheme i issue this invitation assume that you were charged with implementing such a system with complete regard for civil rights and due process what would you do differently in answering this question please accept nsa s fundamental assumptions that both strong cryptography against outsiders and the ability to wiretap some domestic users is necessary if you feel it necessary to challenge those assumptions do it in the context of the last issue i present below right here i m discussing just the technical aspects and no i don t by any means claim that just because something can be done it should be ok steve here s a sketch of an alternative that i believe addresses most of the objections to the clipper scheme notation concatenation exclusive or e m k message m encrypted by key k d m k message m decrypted by key k h m hash digest signature of message m important values u zero x local chip unit key from escrow agency x u one x remote chip unit key from escrow agency x n zero serial number of the local chip n one serial number of the remote chip a number of escrow agencies k zero k one session keys agreed upon external to this protocol f family key need not be secret protocol choose k zero one k zero a such that k zero k zero one k zero a remote chip does same for k one k one one k one a compute the following l zero one e k zero one u zero one l zero a e k zero a u zero a l zero n zero e n zero l zero one l zero a f remote chip does the same for l one one l one a l one send l zero to remote chip and receive l one from remote chip compute ke zero h k zero n zero l zero one l zero a k one d l one f kd zero h k one d l one f k zero n zero l zero one l zero a note that d l one f n one l one one l one a remote chip does the same for ke one and kd one user data is encrypted decrypted with keys ke zero ke one kd zero kd one assumptions no trap doors in e d and h h is not invertible algorithms for e d and h are secret otherwise a software implementation bogus chip could communicate with a real chip the chip only supports the following operation one return n zero two load k zero x three return e k zero x u zero x four return e n zero l zero one l zero a f five given e n one l one one l one a f return n one l one one l one a six load k one seven given e n one l one one l one a f compute ke zero kd zero eight given m return e m ke zero nine given m return d m kd zero anything programmed into the chip can be determined by destroying the chip u one ua f n zero u one ua can not be determined except by destroying the chip unfortunately this may not be true in reality i suppose it s possible to determine how a chip has been programmed with a sophisticatedsp x ray machine to look for blown fuses the u s are programmed independantly by the escrow agencies notes for tapping escrow agency y is given n zero e k zero y u zero y n one e k one y u one y and returns k zero y k one y lea s must contact all escrow agencies with the serial numbers from both chips and the encrypted partial keys this allows the agencies to record that both chips were tapped lea s only get the session key not the key to all conversations of a particular chip this precludes real time decrypting of a conversation but that isn t one of the stated requirements observation in order for any secure by tap able communication scheme to work the active parts need to share a secret and if this secret is revealed communications by those that know the secret can be made un tap able obvious candidates are the cryptographic algorithm and the master family key relative size and complexity suggests that the key can be obtained from a silicon implementation of the scheme a lot easier and faster than the algorithm rsbx raymond s brand rbrand usasoc soc mil
