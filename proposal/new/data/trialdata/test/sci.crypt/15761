 from hanson kronos arc nasa gov robin hanson subject estimating wiretap costs benefits nntp posting host jabberwock arc nasa gov organization nasa arc information sciences division lines one six six would wiretap chip be cost effective by robin hanson draft april two one one nine nine three summary compared to an average monthly phone bill of sixty dollars wiretaps are only worth two cents a month to police so the proposed wiretap chip must raise phone costs by less than one part in three thousand to be cost effective background until now phones have happened to allow the existence of wiretaps detectors which could pick up conversations on a phone line and over time law enforcement agencies have come to rely on this capability to aid in criminal investigations however powerful new encryption technologies threaten this status quo by making possible truly private communication a small chip in each phone could soon make it literally impossible to overhear a conversation without physical microphones at either end in order to preserve the ability of law enforcement agencies to tap phone conversations the u s government announced on april one six one nine nine three that it had developed and begun manufacturing a special wiretap chip to be placed in future phones instead of the total privacy chips which have been under private development the same day at t announced it would use these chips in all its secure telephone products each chip would be created under government supervision when it would be given a fixed indentifier and encryption key periodically during each conversation the chip would broadcast its identifier and other info in a special law enforcement block law enforcement officers with a court order could then obtain the key corresponding to the indentifier from special trust agencies and could thereby listen in on any future or previously recorded conversations on that phone to date most concerns voiced about this plan have been about its security the government won t disclose the encryption algorithm and many suspect the government will not limit its access in the way it has claimed the track record of previous governments does not inspire confidence on this point one however this paper will neglect these concerns and ask instead whether this new wiretap chip is a cost effective tool for police investigation that is which is a cheaper way for society to investigate crime force phone communications to support wiretaps or give police agencies more money to investigate crimes in other ways or to put it another way would police agencies be willing to pay for each wiretap if they had to pay their share of the full social cost of forcing phones to support wiretaps to start to answer this question we might compare the current benefits wiretaps provide to law enforcement agencies with projected costs of implementing the new wiretap chip plan and since current benefits are easier to estimate we begin there wiretap benefits one nine nine zero is the latest year for which wiretap statistics are available two in that year eight seven two wiretap installations were requested and no requests were denied this figure does not include wiretaps obtained with the consent of a party to the conversation two zero five seven arrests resulted from wiretaps started the same year one four eight six arrests came from wiretaps in previous years and five five of arrests led to convictions seven six of the wiretaps were for phones vs pagers email etc six zero were regarding drug offenses and four zero were requested by federal authorities each wiretap installation heard an average of one four eight seven calls two two of them incriminating among one three one people and cost an average of four five one two five extrapolating from the seven nine four installations reporting costs mostly for labor thus a total of about four zero million was spent on wiretaps to obtain about four zero zero zero arrests at one zero zero zero zero per arrest thus these arrests are at least four times more expensive than the two five zero zero per arrest figure one gets by dividing the two eight billion spent by all police nationally by the total one one million non traffic arrests three thus the three zero million per year spent on phone taps is only one thousanth of the total police expenditures and if we divide this by the one three eight million phone access lines in the country three we get about two three cents spent per year per phone line or about two cents a month in general we deter a given class of criminals through a combination of a perceived probability of being caught and convicted and some expected punishment level if convicted so the social value of having wiretaps is no more than the amount that we would have to pay to get the same criminal deterrence through other means if unable to wiretap a particular suspect s phone police might instead use hidden microphones or investigate that suspect in other ways or police might focus on suspects more easily investigated without wiretaps or we might raise the fine or prison time for certain types of crime if we generously assume that these substitutes for wiretaps would be on average twice as expensive as wiretaps then the annual social benefit of phone wiretaps is about equal to the current spending level of two cents a month per phone line wiretap costs let us for the moment optimistically assume that the us government encryption scheme is as secure as whatever private enterprise would have offered instead protecting our conversations from the spying ears of neighbors corporations and governments both foreign and domestic even so the need to support wiretaps would add many additional costs to build and maintain our communication system extra law enforcement blocks would be added to phone transmissions increasing traffic by some unknown percentage a special process must be used to add encryption keys to chips while securely distributing these keys to special agencies which must be funded and monitored the chips themselves are designed by a military contractor whose design is to remain secret and are manufactured through a special process so that the chip becomes nearly impossible to take apart chips are now offered at the relatively high price of three zero a peice in lots of one zero zero zero zero four private encryption systems not supporting wiretaps would require none of these extra costs perhaps most important government degree would at least partially replace private marketplace evolution of standards for how voice is to be represented encrypted and exchanged in our future phones it is widely believed that governments are less efficient than private enterprise in procuring products and standards though they may perhaps perform a useful brokering role when we choose between competing private standards how much less efficient is a matter of debate some say they pay twice as much while others might say only one zero more currently a total of nine six billion is spent as operating expenses of u s phone companies three which comes out to about six zero per month per access line if we compare this to the wiretap value of two cents per month we see that if wiretaps raise average operating costs by even as much as one part in three zero zero zero then wiretaps are not cost effective and this doesn t even include extra costs phone owners pay because their encryption chips are more expensive of course most phones wouldn t have encryption chips for a while but the wiretap benefit per phone is still the same so this argument still applies conclusion given this dramatic difference between the total cost of running the phone system and the value of wiretaps we can justify only the slightest modification of the phone system to accommodate wiretaps when the only modification required was to allow investigators in to attach clips to phone wires wiretap support may have been reasonable but when we consider substantial modification the burden of proof is clearly on those proposing such modification to show that the costs would really be less than the benefits if consensus cannot be obtain on this cost benefit estimate a compromise might be to tax phones which do not support wiretaps at a rate of say five cents per month a tax payable to police agencies
