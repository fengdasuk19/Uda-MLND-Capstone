 from tarnold vnet ibm com todd w arnold subject re can des code be shipped to canada organization ibm cryptographic facility development disclaimer this posting represents the poster s views not those of ibm news software ureply three one lines two two in article rj ri cadre com writes someone in canada asked me to send him some public domain des file encryption code i have is it legal for me to send it i believe it s legal to send des code or equipment from the us to canada with no export license i think this is the only place you can do this all other countries require a license as an aside i ve always thought it should be legal to send des software anywhere if you follow these rules one encrypt your des software with des two send the encrypted software to the recipient three send the key to the recipient the only way the person on the other end can use your des software is if he she already has des available otherwise they can t decrypt your program and it is useless if you ve guaranteed they already have des have you really violated any law by sending it to them in the form of your program i m sure it s still illegal but it seems like a good idea todd
