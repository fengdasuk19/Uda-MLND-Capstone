 from ma one three scf sdcc one four ucsd edu rhett barnes subject zx one one help organization university of california san diego lines one six nntp posting host sdcc one four ucsd edu i need help getting my zx one one c three to behave i ve managed to get the front suspension to be very happy but the rear sucks i can t do anything with it to make it feel ok the bike is very stable through the corners i think because i have the front just right but when the straights get bumpy the rear is torturous it feels like it actually amplifies the bumps and the damping doesn t seem to do anything in real life although you can tell the difference when the bike isn t moving i ve tried four five cm of sag from completeley unloaded but i don t know which way to go has anyone gotten the rear of this bike comfortable and if so what kind of settings esp what sag did you use i like to corner but i also would like my kidneys to remain intact this thing makes the new zx seven feel comfy rbarnes sdcc one three ucsd edu
