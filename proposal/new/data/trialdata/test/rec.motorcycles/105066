 from viking iastate edu dan sorenson subject re why i wanted police officers to answer my posting organization iowa state university ames ia lines six three csundh three zero ursa calvin edu charles sundheim writes some potentially cool story stuff here do share the details how to get a verbal warning for one four six in a five five it s simple first it has to be the first really nice riding day of spring the bike is back together again and so are you grab all your gear put it on and fill the tank with nine four octane premium or better head out in ames there is a road that leads to the little town of gilbert gilbert has one stop light if that tells you something having just gotten the bike back together i thought i d take it for a short ride and check things out heading out of town i went into the twisties at a slow pace just under the speed limit and started leaning around the pace quickened as everything felt just right finally the road straightened and i was ready for a bit of speed grab third gear open her up at roughly nine zero mph grab fourth gear look at as much of the bike as you can and fail to notice a state trooper following a quarter mile behind twist the throttle like a fool grab fifth gear at one three zero or so and see just how well she s been put back together at one four six according to radar i noticed the front fender was flexing a bit thus i slowed pulled off the road removed my helmet and gloves unslung the took kit i was carrying in a fanny pack and was just starting to tighten that fender when the trooper pulled in all hot and flustered have you any idea how fast you were going not precisely no i was paying attention to the bike and road not the instruments i just got her back together last night and i m just out here testing her out before i ride it in traffic my radar says you were at over one four five mph care to tell me why i shouldn t give you a ticket because i was testing the motorcycle away from population and traffic on a strait and flat road while wearing all the protective gear that safety demands note i wasn t quite that eloquent say what kind of bike is that anyway yeah i haven t had my bike out of the garage in years so why were you out here i figure every other idiot on the road is going to look right through me if the bike fails somehow in a three five mph zone i m dead if it holds up out here then i know it will work right in traffic i do this evvery year when i rebuild her not any more you ll find a better place than my highway to do those speeds if i ever catch you speeding on my highway again i m going to nail you for everything i possibly can now get out of my sight before i write you a ticket yes officer and kid keep your eyes open out there and that in a nut shell is how to get a warning for one four six in a five five i don t guarantee that it will work for you but it worked for me
