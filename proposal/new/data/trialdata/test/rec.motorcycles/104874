 from joe rider cactus org joe senner subject re bmw heated grips reply to joe rider cactus org distribution world organization not lines two three bergman panix com mark bergman writes to those of you who have the bmw heated handgrips are they comfortable do they transmit a lot of vibration how do they compare to the stock grips to foam grips i don t have the grips but have looked into getting them it s my understanding that the grips themselves are the standard european style grips now coming standard on the nine three bikes k one one zero zero rs k one one zero zero lt etc it s also my understanding that the heater resides inside the bar itself so if anything i would suspect it would reduce vibration by providing more bar end mass i don t see why they wouldn t work with the old style foam grips aside from the fact that it might cause the foam to deteriorate or something hard to belive considering they do fine in the one zero zero degree texas summers course i don t actually have them so you can save your flames joe senner joe rider cactus org bmw mailing list bmw rider cactus org austin area ride mailing list ride rider cactus org
