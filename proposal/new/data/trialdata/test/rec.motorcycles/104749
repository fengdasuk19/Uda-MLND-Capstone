 from mjs sys uea ac uk mike sixsmith subject re xs eight five zero never needs valve adjustments organization university of east anglia lines one nine smead hpstc zero one rose hp com steve smead writes i bought a yamaha xs eight five zero with eight k miles over the last two years i ve put three zero k of commute miles onnit valve adjustment intervals are suppossed to be every five k well every seven five k or so i ve checked the pad clearences and they never change if anything the clearances seem to be getting a little smaller which makes no sense to me with the pad system the pads should wear until the clearances are too great right i know that threaded adjusters can tighten up but i didn t think these kind could bottom lines is that i haven t touched my valves for three zero k on this bike and they are still nice and quiet and if anything the clearances are tighter what s the deal any other yam triple owners notice extremely long valve adjustment intervals yeah i had an xs seven five zero that was the same the valve seats tend to wear very slowly and anything that might get taken off the pad which shouldn t really wear will tend to compensate so it s a sort of self compensating system
