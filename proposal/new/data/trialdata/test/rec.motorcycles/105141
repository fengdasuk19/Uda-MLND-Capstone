 from chrispi microsoft com chris pirih subject re first bike organization microsoft corporation lines three nine in rec motorcycles james leo belliveau writes i am a serious motorcycle enthusiast without a motorcycle and to put it bluntly it sucks i really would like some advice on what would be a good starter bike for me i do know one thing however i need to make my first bike a good one because buying a second any time soon is out of the question i am specifically interested in racing bikes cbr six zero zero f two gsx r seven five zero i know that this may sound kind of crazy considering that i ve never had a bike before but i am responsible a fast learner and in love responsible and in love i believe that s a contradiction in terms unless you re really brave read reckless a five zero zero cc sport bike will go way faster than you dare for at least your first year of riding getting more than that really is overkill as you ll never even want to use it the following bikes can be bought and repaired cheaply are easy for a novice to manage and are plenty high performance kawasaki ex five zero zero honda vf five zero zero interceptor suzuki gs five five zero e the zero one zero zero mph time of the ex five zero zero at full throttle is way sooner than you re ready for it with something as small as a two five zero you d probably be wishing for more power pretty quickly unless it s a tzr or rgv now i m not saying that you re one zero zero certain to kill yourself immediately with a six zero zero f two or a gsxr seven five zero plenty of people have started riding on those bikes and done just fine what i am saying is that it s a waste of money and a waste of perfectly good plastic when you drop the thing learning how to balance while stopping you ll never get the throttle more than half open anyway so why spend the extra two zero zero zero bucks chris
