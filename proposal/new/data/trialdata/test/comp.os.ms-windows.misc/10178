 from werdna cco caltech edu andrew tong subject re challenge to microsoft supporters organization california institute of technology pasadena lines five eight nntp posting host sandman caltech edu rsrodger wam umd edu yamanari writes i d say that the massive crash problems are exceedingly rare windows itself almost never crashes but it can be crashed by an errant application my personal favorite any one of the corel three zero programs on the other hand i have had os two crash randomly a number of times mostly just running it s own applications i do know that ibm systems the ps two five six slc two in particular have absolutely no problem with os two never had a random crash while running any of my programs under os two in fact i don t remember ever crashing of course i really don t run any os two programs just the same bunch of dos and windows stuff that i ve always been running and when i had the five six slc this is the three eight six slc system running dos windows i had only one crash and it was consistent ftp had a tendency to crash whenever i would get large files one mb from particularly fast clients dtr s one five zero k two zero zero k sec i figured out the problem was with smartdrv s write buffering if i turned off the write buffer everything would work fine ftp under os two has never locked though i can even format floppies to use the most often cited example of the superiority of os two for instance i m still wondering why print preview in a windowed wp five one dos locks up my system yeah i guess i m willing to admit that os two is somewhat sensitive to specific hardware wp five one for dos works perfectly fine on my slc two please explain the only time i wait on anything under windows is when i m copying or formatting a floppy or when printing and even then not long i get nine to one one pages dumped to the printman per minute and can still go do things slowly while it s doing this i ve downloaded with pp nine six zero zero while printing well i save all my personal files to floppy and when i did that under windows a floppy save of a large file hung up the system i also found it quite bothersome to have to continually tweak the tasking options on fractint for dos whenever i wanted to do a fractal computation in the background and not being able to address your memory better than dos not sure what you mean here the idea is that os two s dos sessions can see more memory than windows dos sessions i let xpl a shareware calculus program see around seven two zero kb of free conventional memory which lets me do bigger symbolic manipulations than is possible under straight dos where it would see around six one zero kb of conventional ram i also found it really handy for my own dos based programs which without any re writing could now handle larger data sets simulate for more iterations etc of course the point is now moot since the os two programs i now write simply never run into memory limitations i never programmed for windows so i don t have much of a comparison here though
