 from kayman xenon stanford edu robert kayman subject summary canon bj two zero zero vs hp deskjet five zero zero organization computer science department stanford university lines four zero one hello again about a week and one half ago i posted a query looking for people feelings on the inkjet family of printers specifically a comparison between the canon bj two zero zero bubblejet and the hewlett packard deskjet five zero zero many people asked me to post the summary account of all the postings and e mail i received below is my original query and the responses i received i have not deleted any part of the responses only the headers and signatures so you can extract what you find necessary some people asked me for an unbiased account however the very nature of the question suggests favoritism and biased comments you must extract the information you believe unbiased and a fair representation of each printer there are a wide range of comments each has its own value there was no clear winner some like the bj two zero zero especially its price performance ratio others preferred the durability and reliability of the deskjet the original inkjet with proven drivers and a solid background two new inkjet printers have drawn some attention a new printer to be introduced by hewlett packard later this year around summertime and an addition to the epson product line their first inkjet you will find that after the initial purchase the costs of re filling or replacing the ink cartridges are about the same this largely depends on where you purchase the re fills or replacements so shop around first since this aspect will most likely dominate the cost of your printer no one mentioned approx how many sheets each ink cartridge will print but i suspect they are roughly equal at about one zero zero zero one five zero zero sheets laser printers will do four zero zero zero five zero zero zero sheets per toner cartridge well that s a brief research summary of my personal research enjoy hello fellow netters i am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer i should purchase the canon bj two zero zero bubblejet vs the hp deskjet five zero zero i thought rather than trust the salesperson i would benefit more from relying on those who use these printers daily and use them to their fullest potential and i figure all of you will know their benefits and pitfalls better than any salesperson now i would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the three six zero dpi of the canon bubblejet vs the hewlett packard deskjet five zero zero three zero zero dpi which is faster is there a noticeable print quality difference particularly in graphics which will handle large documents better seven five pages or more any personal experience on either will be appreciated here which works better under windows three one any driver problems etc cost of memory font packages toner cartridges etc basically your personal experiences with either of these machines is highly desirable both good and bad well i bought the bj two zero zero about a month ago at the start of their five zero rebate program on that printer it ends five three one and i bought it from computer discount warehouse because their price of three two five couldn t be beat anywhere i looked and i think it s a hot printer just using regular copier paper produced fantastic results just in high quality mode i compared the output of a micrografx designer legal size drawing with four pt type done on my bj two zero zero with the same drawing printed on an hp laserjet iid and i was amazed how well i could read the small print on the bj two zero zero printing speed was several seconds faster on the bj two zero zero which is amazing considering that the hp has two five m ram installed i measured the time from when the printer first indicated it was receiving data as i used print manager in windows i showed the output to several people at work and one manager bought one immediately for his office and two other engineers placed their orders too if you need cdw s phone number it s eight zero zero five nine eight four two three nine delivery to ny was two days good luck craig witkowski ceng five one maccvm corp mot com motorola communications electronics inc glen rock nj i own a deskjet five zero zero performance isn t spectacular under windows using truetype fonts but neither is the canon from what i have seen quality for the hp is very much dependent on paper quality on standard photo copy paper the characters have slightly frayed edges but on better quality distinction type paper things look better for most applications i find copy paper fine still better than dot matrix comes with a windows driver which seems to by pass print manager has a few intelli fonts which are hp scaleable fonts probably faster than truetype but haven t really tried them out can get ram font cartridges but unless the speed of truetype is a problem i wouldn t bother the ram cartridges can t be used as buffer soft fonts only for graphics i e bmp images etc the hp can be put into a dither mode via the hp supplied win driver there a number of dither options such as scatter pattern etc the manual gives recommendations depending on the type of image being printed text is not so good in this mode problem arises when you have a document which contains both graphic and text the range of tones for graphic images isn t brilliant but i think that is more of a limitation with inkjet printers in general from what i have seen the canon is similar in most respects however a printer definitely worth looking at is the new inkjet from epson this printer is faster cheaper and capable of producing laser like quality on normal copier paper can t remember the model lx something i think i purchased my hp days before the epson was released here the introductory price on the epson was the same as the hp here in new zealand about a month ago i got a canon bj two zero zero i absolutely love it it is incredibly fast except for printing from pspice i don t know if you ever do stuff with that or not most of the stuff i print is either from microsoft word for windows or just plain text the only problems i ve had are printing headers footers the printer freaked out and printing on cheap paper lots of streaks normal copy paper works great with it you can only tell it s not laser printed by holding it oh less than twelve inches from your face that is if you re nearsighted like me the printer comes with its own driver for windows three one i have no other complaints the printer also can act just like some epson or another for those archaic software packages that haven t written a driver for it yet the teeny weeny footprint is a real plus too and if you purchase it between now and may three one you get a five zero rebate from canon i bought mine from a store called compusa and the price now is three four zero i have a friend who has the hp you are looking at it also prints very well and everyone has drivers for it but it is very slow hope i helped three six zero dpi sure looks great heather stehman in article ceng five one

as i used print manager in windows i guess i have some experience with both i have a bj three zero zero at work and a deskjet five zero zero at home i prefer the deskjet the printing speed and quality are similar i tested both with text and graphics before buying the deskjet for home the feature that sets the deskjet apart is the driver support in so many applications the bj ends up emulating the epson lq or ibm proprinter to get it to work with many non windows apps and this will be the case for a long time the design is superior if you just want to use cut paper the deskjet is quieter and the ink cartridges are quite a bit cheaper due to the number of deskjets out there in comparision to the bjs just my zero zero two worth mike mattix agricultural group of monsanto p o box one seven four luling la seven zero zero seven zero internet address dmmatt bigez monsanto com yes there is the landscape mode printing problem but it does not present a problem in windows as the windows printer driver handles the translation i actually thought of some other points after i posted the note the deskjet has an unprintable area of approximately five inch around the paper the bubblejet does not you are right about the graphics resolutions i tested the printers with the applications i had access to wordperfect harvard graphics wingif paintshop pro and paintbrush and could not tell a difference in fact one of the hp deskjet windows drivers gives you significant control over the contrast and density of the printer hence controlling the amount of ink you put down the bubblejet did not i had no imaging software to test the printers with and so had no comparision there finally i wanted sheet feeding in that configuration the bubblejet cost approximately one zero zero more than the deskjet i went through a pretty thorough evaluation and chose the deskjet when i spent my own money btw i am replacing the bj three zero zero with a deskjet five zero zero at work this month anyway regards mike mattix ag group of monsanto luling la i spent some time comparing the two we ended up getting the bubblejet bj two zero zero versus the hp our reasons were one the hp seemed to have worse banding than the canon two three six zero dpi versus three zero zero we felt we could see the difference three price canon has a five zero rebate program going on at the moment the bj two zero zero was our choice over the bj one zero ex we could have one zero zero pages in the bj two zero zero feeder the bj one zero ex holds only three zero pages i think as you can see up to one zero zero pages on the bj two zero zero we haven t done anything big with the bj but its performance seems reasonable under windows i know that the microsoft bbs has a newer windows driver than comes with the printer but i don t know how it compares also the driver included with the printer is canon s whereas i don t know where the microsoft bbs one comes from microsoft hope this helps thomas v frauenhofer wa two yyw tvf cci com uunet uupsi cci six three two tvf tvf cs rit edu mandlebratwurst the meal that eats itself altough i m sometimes also a salesperson if i m not suppost to study i would recommend to buy the bj two zero zero the printing quality is a bit better but you you ve got much more possiblities don t forget the hp engine is at least two years on the marked the canon engine witch is also used in other new bubblejet printers like e g the epson ones is quite recently available now i would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the three six zero dpi of the canon bubblejet vs the hewlett packard deskjet five zero zero three zero zero dpi which is faster is there a noticeable print quality difference particularly in graphics which will handle large documents better seven five i ve seen during a short demonstration from someone who tryed to sell me canon printers two times the same picture one printed with the bj two zero zero one with the canon the other with the hp and there was a difference in printing quality the canon was a bit better greetz kris when we decided we needed quiet printers in our hospital we looked to inkjet printers they have near laser quality speed and they are quiet we use both hp deskjets and the canon bj two zero zero s i prefer the paper handling qualities of the deskjets but i feel the canons have superior print quality the ideal would be a canon with a sheet feeder however i did end up buying a deskjet for home use got too good a deal anyway we are using canons in high volume areas and they are holding up very well out of one five deskjets and four bj two zero zero s i have only had one problem with a deskjet and that was taken care of very quickly by hp nate whenever i buy anything i look at what the experts say pick out the top few and then buy on whatever criteria are the most apt i ve been unusually flush lately no begging letter please and so i ve done this a few times including about four months ago with inkjet printers i can t remember much about the process except that i read about three reviews of inkjets and that the five zero zero was always at or near the top i bought the five zero zero c because of the added dimension of colour i intend to build a multi media machine at some stage and have just bought a colour scanner towards that although i haven s used the colour thing in earnest yet i tried it out on a couple of windows bitmaps and i was pleased with the result i note that even though you can now get the five five zero c the one with both colour and mono with no need to change the cartridge the five zero zero c and five zero zero are still readily available at least in the uk the following are my views experience one i don t know anything about the canon except that i came away from reviews and replies to a posting similar to yours with the idea that the hp offered the best performance price ratio two i believe hp are the originals in the field not always the ideal place to be but the market s still young so one assumes they have the expertise three the five zero zero c is worth the extra operation in mono is perfectly acceptable and i get good crisp reproduction of fonts from windows four i used to work for monotype when they still manufactured typesetters before their american owners closed them down and i can tell you that in terms of definition three zero zero dpi is pretty poor anyway so three six zero dpi is just a bit less poor five the hp comes with a reasonable set of drivers six if you buy it invest in the additional ram pack it s pretty slow with it god knows what it s like without i actually work in germany and my pc is home in the uk so it s not in daily use i would say that apart from my not reading the manual properly and having a really dumb problem at the start it s easy peasy to operate hope this is of use regards david just bought the bj two zero zero i thought the price couldn t be beat three two nine with five zero rebate thru five three one and so far it is comparable even superior to the deskjet in print quality speed per page rate seems to be faster i don t have figures i don t print long docs though quality i think the graphics quality is excellent print quality is excellent as well unless you use small fonts and hold it up close you can see a lot more jaggies than on a laserjet the three six zero dpi is offset by a little less accuracy in holding the page print head in place i would imagine large docs not room in the standard model for a whole lotta pages manual says up to one zero zero though haven t tried it drivers no problems under win three one yet winword doesn t want to print the envelopes the same way the canon does though know nothing of add on costs daniel a hartung dhartung chinet chinet com ask me about rotaract the deskjet is slow this is in comparison to the other printers i mentioned i have no idea how the bubblejet compares the interface between win three one and the printer is just dandy i ve not had any problems with it i just bought a bj two zero zero printer a couple of days ago i compared it to the sample print of an hp deskjet five zero zero and knew that the hp wasn t for me the bj two zero zero is pretty fast and really prints with good quality i can compare it with the hp laserjet iiid postscript and they look almost identical depending on the kind of paper i don t have problems with the ink not being dry it seems to dry very fast probably within a second since canon is giving a five zero rebate until the end of may it is really a good buy sean eckton computer support representative college of fine arts and communications wow it s funny you should ask this i m a little behind in news reading so i know this may be late i just purchased the canon bubblejet last night i was really worried that i wouldn t like it but the print quality and noise level is fantastic i printed quite a few documents with lots of graphics and it printed damn near laser quality you can t tell it s not laser unless you get two inches from the page no problems with drivers the printer came with the driver diskette which is good because i was beginning to panic when i couldn t findi it under windows or wordperfect it works well under both i have yet to install word for windows so don t know how it works with them i had a deskjet five zero zero at work last year it was a good printer as well ut i felt it was awfully slow and much noisier than the bubblejet i won t say the bubblejet is much better but i really do like it more just my zero zero two worth brett sincerely robert kayman kayman cs stanford edu or cpa cs stanford edu in theory theory and practice are the same in practice they are not you mean you want the revised
