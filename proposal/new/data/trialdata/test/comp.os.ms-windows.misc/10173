bferrell ant occ uc edu brett ferrell writes in article ludes hubcap clemson edu larry ludes ludwig writes munch you must of read too many os two advertisements crash protection is such a marketing gimick it isn t funny out of four months of using windows on my new machine i ve only had it crash once and i don t have a run of the mill configuration munch following is reformatted it does sound funny i will admit but for me it is true windows crashed on all of the time and from what i have read in pc mag this is not the exception i d say that the massive crash problems are exceedingly rare windows itself almost never crashes but it can be crashed by an errant application my personal favorite any one of the corel three zero programs on the other hand i have had os two crash randomly a number of times mostly just running it s own applications for instance today i discovered a new one while i was downloading with procomm plus for windows running seamless with the standard vga drivers on a run o da mill vga card six four zero x four eight zero i decided that i wanted to edit a copy of a quote that i wanted to add to my finger but since i ve learned not to really trust seamless i fired up a full screen winos two three one session whoops the download finished while winos two was loading it had just gotten the pointer up so i hit alt escape to get back t the desktop i have a lot of fonts so loading takes a good long while blam screen trashed procomm hangs up hm well i can sorta see the mouse so i clicked on the minimized winos two session and got back my fullscreen windows session but the color were off red and green and yellow and brown instead of blues and greys so i closed this and got back to the desktop now fully restored pp was still sitting window open but it was no longer connected to the com port so i exited it the normal way it told me i was still online and it would hang up though it was already hung up hm well load anothe no bad idea shutdown and reboot ok refresh first now shutdown yes everything is closed hm nothing seems to be happening let s see ah the windows list still comes up ok let s try shutdown again no go huh alright wait six zero seconds to see if it s just running slow hmm still seems to be running os two try shutdown again nothing oh well reboot enjoy the checkdisk time in this case a part of the os crashed not only itself but os two entirely which isn t even smart enough to tell when it s been compromised i guess in everyday specifically today use os two gives each windows app a vdm and they can t touch each other or generally anything they aren t supposed to have that s the idea anyway in truth when a program crashes on os two it will bring the system down with it the programs that would just gpf under windows do the same under os two but programs that are fine under dos and windows bring os two screaming to a halt task protection or no for instance i m still wondering why print preview in a windowed wp five one dos locks up my system it works fine under dos or even in a dos box under windows three one admittedly it doesn t crash if i run wp five one full screen but the first time this bug big me it bit hard if windows works for you then great maybe this is why some people don t see why os two is the os of choice if windows doesn t crash on you and you don t mind waiting on each task please explain the only time i wait on anything under windows is when i m copying or formatting a floppy or when printing and even then not long i get nine to one one pages dumped to the printman per minute and can still go do things slowly while it s doing this i ve downloaded with pp nine six zero zero while printing and not being able to adress your memory better than dos not sure what you mean here os two sees one six megs uses five or six of these for it s own use more if you want to count winos two windows sees one six megs uses three or four more like five if you count the disk cache as i am for os two for itself if memory efficiency were a big issue pc geos would be the current king of the intel desktop some of the key reasons for using os two are gone i probably would still use it but it would be more of an even fight on the other hand i am finally able to say with some confidence that both os two and windows have a bit of hardware sensitivity to them for instance the machine i am sitting at runs both fine while the machine next to me constantly locks up under windows but ran os two without a hitch once i got it through a five crash install on the whole i d say os two is a whole lot more sensitive than windows but there are i suppose machines that windows just doesn t like wittism of th week i think that it s wrong to believe in an ism you should believe in yourself ferrish bueller wasn t this ferris bueller there are stupid laws and then there are stupider than normal laws
