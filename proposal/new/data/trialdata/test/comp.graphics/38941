 from osprey ux four cso uiuc edu lucas adamski subject re fast polygon routine needed keywords polygon needed organization university of illinois at urbana champaign lines two two in article jesse eye com jesse lackey writes in article alan saturn cs swin oz au alan christiansen writes i believe that the algorithms you can get that will only draw convex polygons can be much more efficient than those that can draw concave self intersecting polygons this efficiency can largely be attributed to the fact that simple convex polygons only have a left and a right edge on each scan line complex figure eight type polygons can be a bit trickier it is true the convex algorithm is faster than a general concave multi outline algorithm but not tremendously faster i spent awhile implementing and optimizing both flavors and the convex turned out about one zero faster this is all c on hp pa risc the compiler got the inner loop shooting the span as fast as possible as far as i could tell for any sort of game the database to render is known ahead of time and can be made all convex definitely the way to go ok thanks for help everyone i still haven t found quite what i m looking for but i ve got finals coming up soon so i have to put all this on hold thanx lucas
