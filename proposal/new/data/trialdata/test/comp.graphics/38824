 from lilley v five cgu mcc ac uk chris lilley subject re four eight bit graphics keywords four eight bit alpha channel image lines four one reply to c c lilley mcc ac uk organization computer graphics unit mcc in article oehler yar cs wisc edu wonko the sane writes i was recently talking to a possible employer mine and he made a reference to a four eight bit graphics computer image processing system i seem to remember it being called image or something akin to that anyway he claimed it had four eight bit color a one two bit alpha channel that s six zero bits of info what could that possibly be for specifically the four eight bit color that s two eight zero trillion colors many more than the human eye can resolve is this an anti aliasing thing or is this just some magic number to make it work better with a certain processor well four eight bit colour could be for improved resolution but one six bits per channel seems like a bit excessive i have seen a paper that quoted one zero bits per channel of one two bits for computational precision more than that would seem to be wasted perhaps the frame buffer uses another colourspace which needs more bits to represent the full range rgb is a cube so it is a compact encoding most likely however is that there are two separate two four bit eight bits per component frame buffers this set up called double buffering allows a complex three d picture to be built up on one buffer while the other buffer containing the previous frame is displayed this makes for smoother animation sadly i have access to none of them just a dec five zero zero zero two five sigh well hey if you want to brag about numbers the five zero zero zero range can take a pxg turbo card with nine six bits per pixel full double buffering two two four bit buffers a two four bit z buffer and an extra two four bit buffer for off screen image storage mind you the card costs more than your workstation chris lilley technical author itti computer graphics and visualisation training project computer graphics unit manchester computing centre oxford road manchester uk m one three nine pl internet c c lilley mcc ac uk voice four four zero six one two seven five six zero four five fax four four zero six one two seven five six zero four zero janet c c lilley uk ac mcc
