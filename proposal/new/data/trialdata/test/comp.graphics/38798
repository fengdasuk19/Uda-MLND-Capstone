 from dfr usna navy mil prof d rogers eas fac subject re newsgroup split organization u s naval academy lines two three in article mart four six seven eight mach one wlu ca phil martin u writes chris herringshaw tdawson engin umich edu wrote concerning the proposed newsgroup split i personally am not in favor of doing this i learn an awful lot about all aspects of graphics by reading this group from code to hardware to algorithms i just think making five different groups out of this is a wate and will only result in a few posts a week per group i kind of like the convenience of having one big forum for discussing all aspects of graphics anyone else feel this way just curious yes i also like knowing where to go to ask a question without getting hell for putting it in the wrong newsgroup i am also against splitting the group the traffic will decrease on any given subject but the required net bandwidth will increase because of multiply cross postings i just went through this with another group i continuously read it is now almost at the point where it is no longer worth reading strongly suggest not doing this dave rogers
