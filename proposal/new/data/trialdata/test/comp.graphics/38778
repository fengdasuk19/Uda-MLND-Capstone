servers that will send you things like this in response to a message see item one three below for details on some also the newsgroup alt graphics pixutils is specifically for discussion of software like this you may find useful information there eight format documents for tiff iff biff nff off fits etc you almost certainly don t need these read the above item seven on free image manipulation software get one or more of these packages and look through them chances are excellent that the image converter you were going to write is already there but if you still want one of the format documents many such files are available by anonymous ftp from zamenhof cs rice edu in directory pub graphics formats these files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct this archive includes pixel formats and two and three dimensional object formats the future of this archive is uncertain at the moment as mark hall will apparently no longer be maintaining it a second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintained by quincey koziol koziol ncsa uiuc edu the latest version exists at ftp ncsa uiuc edu in misc file formats graphics formats apparently neither of these is complete you might want to check both fits stands for flexible image transport system it s a file format most often used in astronomy despite the name it can contain not only images but other things as well there is a regular monthly fits basics and information posting on sci astro fits read it if you want to know more nine converting between vector formats a lot of people ask about converting from hpgl to postscript or macdraw to cgm or whatever it is important to understand that this is a very different problem from the image format conversions in item seven converting one image format to another is a fairly easy problem since once you get past all the file header junk a pixel is a pixel the basic objects are the same for all image formats this is not so for vector formats the basic objects circles ellipses drop shadowed pattern filled round cornered rectangles etc vary from one format to another except in extremely restricted cases it is simply not possible to do a one to one conversion between vector formats there is software for converting to and from cgm files on ftp psc edu the contributor states that it runs on unix ms windows and possibly the mac a better more specific blurb would be most welcome on the other hand it is quite possible to do a close approximation rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another as far as i know no one has put together a general toolkit of such converters but two different hpgl to postscript converters have been posted to comp sources misc check the index on your nearest archive site a related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format to a bitmapped image from postscript to sun raster format or hpgl to x one one bitmap for example some of the commercial postscript clones for pc s allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer also the postscript interpreters in the next box and in sun s x one one news can be used to render to a file if you re clever but in general the answer is no however if someone were to put together a vector to vector conversion toolkit adding a vector to raster converter would be trivial gnu ghostscript from the fsf current version two five two includes drivers for both ppm and gif format files thus it can be used as a postscript to ppm or a postscript to gif filter it implements essentially all of postscript level one

one four how to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to infinity if it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way the point is within the polygon if the ray crosses an even number of edges the point is either outside the polygon or within an interior hole formed from intersecting polygon edges this idea is known in the trade as the jordan curve theorem see eric haines article in glassner s ray tracing book above for more information including treatment of special cases another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all the vertices on the polygon if the sum is two pi the point is inside if the sum is zero the point is outside however this method is about an order of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the trigonometric functions is usually quite costly code for both methods plus barycentric triangle testing can be found in the ray tracing news vol
