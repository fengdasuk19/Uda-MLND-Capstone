 from jk eight seven three seven seven lehtori cc tut fi kouhia juhana subject re xv problems organization tampere university of technology lines one zero zero distribution world nntp posting host cc tut fi in article c c lilley mcc ac uk writes in article jk eight seven three seven seven lehtori cc tut fi kouhia juhana writes i wrote something about making color modifications quickly with eight bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the two four bit image this makes sense because the main use of xv is only viewing images doing many changes to image we should keep all modifications in a buffer and then before making the operations to two four bit image we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations think about what you are saying here the two four bit image is quantised down to eight bits so many similar colours are mapped onto a single palette colour this colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways you then want to apply these modifications back to the two four bit file so you have to find which colours mapped to this one palette colour i suppose you don t know what about we have discussed we discussed about error s in xv two two one which shows images only as eight bit and my suggestion above works perfectly with it so far i have seen a colormap editing window in xv that is there must be a colormap anyway the problems you present are exist anyway and i didn t tried to solve them at all because i would not make such problems to my programs in the first place gamma and color corrections are easily done to two four bit image as i presented there s no need make tricks from eight bit quantized image back to two four bit image how would you suggest doing colour editing on a two four bit file how would you group related colours to edit them together only global changes could be done unless the software were very different and much more complicated ok you re writing about situation that user want edit images as two four bit and user want edit individual colors your questions by the way jumps off the discussion a bit my solution doesn t work because there s no colormap withing real two four bit image you see user see two four bit image going back to eight bit is silly about changing individual colors in eight bit quantized rasterized image changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most cases if the image is quantized and rasterized small change may make serious errors to anywhere in the image xv allows this feature but i don t recommend to use it with the mentioned type images moreover xv is not a paint program you can only make those global changes in full two four bit xv changing individual colors sounds like paint program job if person have eight bit screen there s need for tricks to get the original two four bit image modified because user don t see full two four bit image there s need to make approximations and it is not possible to modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups if image is rasterized to select indiavidual color there could be seven x seven cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area selecting individual color is possible from that ok i don t have thought very much two four bit painting programs never seen such in good view and are not planned to make such not to mention two four bit painting program in eight bit screen yes again what is was wrong with xv it saved eight bit quantized rasterized images as two four bit jpegs jpeg is not designed for that also human expect that two four bit will be saved as two four bit image say person would like to crop part of the image and save it then it is expected that the image still is the same so xv were designed without thinking about human interface and how human expect the program work design error i have heard xv were designed first for eight bit images files but it were not good idea to take full two four bit images without making major change to the original design so even all screen images are eight bit the processed images and saved images could have been two four bit very easily instead of eight bit before anybody will make a note yes i may as well make a lift where up means that the lift goes down and down means that the lift goes up and put a note on this design solution to the manuals however even the manuals tells the correct situation it doesn t solve the problem americans the lift is just an example well my text may be a bit hard reading hopefully you suggeeded to read it juhana kouhia
