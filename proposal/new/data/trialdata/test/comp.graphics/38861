 from lioness maple circa ufl edu subject kubota kenai denali specs organization center for instructional and research computing activities lines one one eight reply to lioness ufcc ufl edu nntp posting host maple circa ufl edu okay i got enough replies about the kubota kenai denali systems that i will post a summary of their capabilities i haven t actually used one or seen one so take the specs with a grain of salt i d like to see an independent review of one against say an sgi indigo extreme or something basically the kenai workstations are dec alpha axp based workstations that run osf one dec s and will likely run windows nt in the future they are binary compatible with digital s osf one alpha axp implementation denali is their graphics subsystem which is upgradable in the field by simply adding transformation engines the two main kenai machines are the three four zero zero imaging and three d graphics workstation and the three five zero zero imaging and three d graphics workstation three four zero zero three five zero zero cpu dec alpha axp one three three mhz dec alpha axp one five zero mhz on chip cache eight k eight k eight k eight k onboard cache five

stencil eight bit eight bit stereo support yes yes other both machines will double buffer or do stereo output per window both have an auxiliary video output that is rs one seven zero a ntsc and pal storage internal fixed two three five four three five internal removable one five two five two five two five max capacity nine five gb one one six gb io both have turbochannel one zero zero mb sec scsi two ethernet and fddi application programming interfaces both have libraries for xlib motif mit pexlib dec pexlib dec phigs and gl okay now the real stuff the kenai stations work with a graphics architecture known as denali the denali comes in three models the e p and v they use a decchip two one zero six four superscalar risc processor at one five zero mhz their capabilities are as follows e

zero two zero transform engine mod one three three five five six as you can see these are pretty powerful workstations and the best part is the pricing i would recommend that you call kubota for more information their number is four zero eight seven two seven eight one zero zero i m sure they ll send you an information you may want oh some prices low end kenai three four zero zero e series w one tem and five fbm two seven seven nine five dollars u s kenai three five zero zero e series w one tem and five fbm four five three four five dollars u s high end kenai three four zero zero v series w six tem and two zero fbm six one seven nine five dollars u s kenai three five zero zero v series w six tem and two zero fbm seven nine three four five dollars u s if someone could post a relative comparision with an indigo extreme or something i would appreciate it hope this helps someone out there brian ps i am not affiliated with kubota in any way hell i thought they made tractors or something
