 from kwansik kim subject triangulized data wanted with texture to be mapped organization indiana university computer science bloomington lines one zero i need triangulized data of some nice looking model with some texture mapping it would be better if the parametric values of each vertex for the surface before triangulized are avaliable along with the euclidean points so that we could use them for texture mapping thanks kwansik
