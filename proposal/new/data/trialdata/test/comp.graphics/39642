 from u seven seven one one five zero one bicmos ee nctu edu tw jih shin ho subject disp one four zero zero seven organization national chiao tung university x newsreader tin version one one pl eight lines two nine nine i have posted disp one four zero zip to alt binaries pictures utilities i will upload this package to simtel two zero later you may distribute this program freely for non commercial use if no fee is gained there is no warranty the author is not responsible for any damage caused by this program important changes since version one three five added support for iris support mix concat two images added support for batch conversion added support for load save palette table added support for edge enhance added support for crop one line added support for negate image new color quantization option fix some minor bugs one introduction this program can let you read write and display images with different formats it also let you do some special effects rotation dithering on image its main purpose is to let you convert image among different formts include simple file management system support slide show support batch conversion there is no limit on image size currently this program supports eight one five one six two four bits display if you want to use hicolor or truecolor you must have vesa driver if you want to modify video driver please read section eight two hardware requirement pc three eight six or better msdos three three or higher min amount of ram is four m bytes maybe less memory will also work i recommend min eight m bytes for better performance hard disk for swapping virtual memory the following description is borrowed from djgpp supported wares up to one two eight m of extended memory expanded under vcpi up to one two eight m of disk space used for swapping supervga two five six color mode up to one zero two four x seven six eight eight zero three eight seven xms vdisk memory allocation strategies vcpi programs such as qemm desqview and three eight six max unsupported dpmi microsoft windows features eight zero three eight seven emulator three two bit unix ish environment flat memory model svga graphics three installation video drivers emu three eight seven and go three two exe are borrowed from djgpp if you use western digital vga chips read readme wd this go three two exe is a modified version for vesa and is completely compatible with original version but some people report that this go three two exe is not compatible with other djgpp programs in their system if you encounter this problem don t put go three two exe within search path please read runme bat for how to run this program if you choose xxxxx grn as video driver add nc two five six to environment go three two for example go three two driver x xxxxx xxxxx grn nc two five six if you don t have eight zero x eight seven add emu x xxxxx emu three eight seven to environment go three two for example go three two driver x xxxxx xxxxx grd emu x xxxxx emu three eight seven notes one i only test tr eight nine zero zero grn et four zero zero zero grn and vesa grn other drivers are not tested two i have modified et four zero zero zero grn to support eight one five one six two four bits display you don t need to use vesa driver if et four zero zero zero grn doesn t work please try vesa grn three for those who want to use hicolor or

video driver only one when you run this program you will enter read menu whthin this menu you can press any function key if you move or copy files you will enter write menu the write menu is much like read menu but only allow you to change directory the header line in read menu includes d xx f xx t xx d display type f number of files t number of tagged files pressing space in read menu will let you select which format to use for reading current file pressing return in read menu will let you reading current file this program will automatically determine which format this file is the procedure is first check magic number if fail check standard extension still fail report error pressing s or s in read menu will do slide show if delay time is zero program will wait until you hit a key except escape if any error occurs program will make a beep w or w to pause any key to continue escape to terminate pressing ins in read menu will change display type pressing alt x in read menu will quit program without prompting pressing f five will turn on effect menu two once image file is successfully read you will enter screen menu you can do special effect on image pressing return show image in graphic mode press return space or escape to return to text mode pressing tab change processing target this program allows you to do special effects on eight bit or two four bit image pressing left right arrow change display type eight one five one six two four bits pressing space save current image to file b w dither save as black white image one bit grey scale save as grey image eight bits full color save as color image eight bits true color save as two four bit image this program will ask you some questions if you want to write image to file some questions are format dependent finally this program will prompt you a filename if you want to save file under another directory other than current directory please press space after pressing space you will enter write two menu you can change directory to what you want then pressing space this program will prompt you original filename pressing return this program will prompt you selected filename filename under bar three this program supports eight one five one six two four bits display four this program is memory greedy if you don t have enough memory the performance is poor five if you want to save eight bits image try gif then tiff lzw then targa then sun raster then bmp then if you want to save two four bits image lossless try tiff lzw or targa or ilbm or sun raster no one is better for true two four bits image six i recommend jpeg for storing two four bits images even eight bits images seven not all subroutines are fully tested eight this document is not well written if you have any problem suggestion comment about this program please send to u seven seven one one five zero one bicmos ee nctu edu tw one four zero one one three one one one three i need your suggestion to improve this program there is no anonymous ftp on this site eight tech information program user interface and some subroutines written by jih shin ho some subroutines are borrowed from xv two two one and pbmplus dec nine one tiff v three two and jpeg v four reading writing are through public domain libraries compiled with djgpp you can get whole djgpp package from simtel two zero or mirror sites for example wuarchive wustl edu mirrors msdos djgpp nine for thoese who want to modify video driver one get grx source code from simtel two zero or mirror sites two for hicolor and truecolor one five bits of colors is set to three two seven six eight one six bits of colors is set to zero xc zero one zero two four bits of colors is set to zero xc zero one eight acknowledgment i would like to thank the authors of xv and pbmplus for their permission to let me use their subroutines also i will thank the authors who write tiff and jpeg libraries thank dj without djgpp i can t do any thing on pc jih shin ho u seven seven
