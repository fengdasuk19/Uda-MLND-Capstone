 from jk eight seven three seven seven lehtori cc tut fi kouhia juhana subject re xv problems organization tampere university of technology lines four seven distribution world nntp posting host cc tut fi in article c c lilley mcc ac uk writes two yes xv is an eight bit program this is not a bug never claimed it is a bug xv can import two four bit images and quantises them down to eight bits this is a handy facility not a bug never claimed it is a bug how would you suggest doing colour editing on a two four bit file how would you group related colours to edit them together only global changes could be done unless the software were very different and much more complicated if you want to do colour editing on a two four bit image you need much more powerfull software which is readily available commercially i guess i edited my note on this away from the article i posted to many newsgroups i wrote something about making color modifications quickly with eight bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the two four bit image this makes sense because the main use of xv is only viewing images doing many changes to image we should keep all modifications in a buffer and then before making the operations to two four bit image we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations and lastly jpeg is a compression algorithm it can be applied to any image of arbitrary bit depth again this is not a bug never claimed it is a bug i tried kept sure i don t claim that jpeg is noting else than a compression algorithm because i know what the jpeg is you propably misunderstood what i wrote as you have done in many places so far you also missed what is were wrong with xv however i did wrote it juhana kouhia
