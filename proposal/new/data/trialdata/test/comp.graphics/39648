 organization arizona state university from eric davis subject re help three ds lines one one in article stephenc says in three d studio is there any way to create refraction diffraction etc i want to simulate such things as glass lenses bottles etc there might be an ipas routine that does that but i can r be sure another way to do it is to render the scene without the glass object and save the image then assign that image to your glass object as a reflection it will take a lot of adjusting for position and size of the reflection but that s the only thing i can think of
