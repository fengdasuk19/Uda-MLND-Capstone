watson ibm com organization visualization systems ibm keywords computer graphics ray tracing volume rendering scientific visualization of chemical systems cornell theory center summer school offered through the cornell school of continuing education and summer sessions course description within the past ten years the simulation and modeling of lines one nine seven molecules has evolved from an esoteric academic subject into a international industry computer graphics has played a decisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists to build visualize and interact with complex geometrical objects while computer scientists are conversant in the language of their own discipline they are often unfamiliar with the terminology simulation techniques and practical needs of research chemists similarly chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigms and technological advances in graphical computing this interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gap between computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistry researchers who wish to be more than just casual users of prepackaged graphics software although this is not intended to be a course in computational chemistry or drug design data sets from chemical research problems will be used in lab and students will be encouraged to bring data sets of their own lab exercises and projects will be carried out using data flow programming ibm visualization data explorer software and students will have access to cornell theory center computing resources including video recording equipment audience researchers and students in the chemical and biological sciences interested in integrating state of the art computer graphics into their research computer scientists wishing to gain familiarity with a major application of scientific visualization the class size will be limited to two five participants on a first come first served basis level graduate advanced undergraduate one or two credits may be taken without credit as a workshop calculus linear algebra and introductory chemistry required familiarity with unix x windows and c is useful but not required date june one four two five one nine

with laboratory exercises and ample time will be provided for project enablement and familiarization with the new computing environment students enrolled for one credit will be graded on the basis of their laboratory exercises and short final project those enrolled for a second credit will receive more advanced lectures be given more time for project development and meet daily to share experience
