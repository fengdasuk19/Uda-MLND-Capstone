 from jesup cbmvax cbm commodore com randell jesup subject re products to handle hdtv moving pircture one eight zero mb sec reply to jesup cbmvax cbm commodore com randell jesup organization commodore west chester pa lines three one kazsato twics co jp writes i d like to know if there is any system cpu hd array framebuffer which can play and record hdtv quality moving picture in realtime hdtv has about six mb frame so recording playing moving picture will need about one eight zero mb sec bandwidth i m thinking to treat the raw data not compressed actually for digital hdtv systems that s far higher bandwidth than you need unless there s some reason you must work in fully uncompressed hdtv also my calculations is that each frame should be well under six mb even using two four bits pixel which is more bits than you actually need one five or one eight should be enough for a moving picture one six zero zero x one one zero zero x one six bits is three five mb i m guessing at hdtv resolution it may be a bit wider than one six zero zero i m fairly sure of the one one zero zero number for most of the digital proposals i hope you have a very fast memory system as well one eight zero mb s while displaying will require a heavily interleaved vram system unless you have a very compelling reason i d advise trying to use at least somewhat compressed data you don t have to go to full compression to get to a level where the data io requirements are much cheaper and easier to deal with gnu emacs is a lisp operating system disguised as a word processor doug mohney in comp arch randell jesup jack of quite a few trades commodore engineering jesup cbmvax commodore com or rutgers cbmvax jesup bix rjesup disclaimer nothing i say is anything other than my personal opinion
