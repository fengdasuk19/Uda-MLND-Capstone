 from ldo waikato ac nz lawrence d oliveiro waikato university subject quicktime performance was re rumours about three do organization university of waikato hamilton new zealand lines six seven ok with all the discussion about observed playback speeds with quicktime the effects of scaling and so on i thought i d do some more tests first of all i felt that my original speed test was perhaps less than realistic the movie i had been using only had one eight frames in it it was a version of the very first movie i created with the compact video compressor i decided something a little longer would give closer to real world results for better or for worse i pulled out a copy of two zero zero one a space odyssey that i had recorded off tv a while back about fifteen minutes into the movie there s a sequence where the earth shuttle is approaching the space station specifically i digitized a portion of about three zero seconds duration zooming in on the rotating space station i figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between frames to increase the differences between frames i digitized it at only five frames per second to give a total of one seven one frames i captured the raw footage at a resolution of three eight four two eight eight pixels with the spigot card in my centris six five zero quarter size resolution from a pal source i then imported it into premiere and put it through the compact video compressor keeping the five fps frame rate i created two versions of the movie one scaled to three two zero two four zero resolution the other at one six zero one two zero resolution i used the default two zero zero quality setting in premiere two zero one and specified a key frame every ten frames i then ran the three two zero two four zero movie through the same raw speed test program i used for the results i d been reporting earlier result a playback rate of over four five frames per second that s right i was getting a much higher result than with that first short test movie just for fun i copied the three two zero two four zero movie to my external hard disk a quantum lp one zero five s and ran it from there this time the playback rate was only about three five frames per second obviously the two three zero mb internal hard disk also a quantum is a significant contributor to the speed of playback i modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional scaling factors and tried playing back the one six zero one two zero movie scaled to three two zero two four zero size this time the playback speed was over six zero fps clearly the poster who observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing quicktime one zero in action not one five i d try my tests with quicktime one zero but i don t think it s entirely compatible with my centris and system seven one unscaled the playback rate for the one six zero one two zero movie was over one zero zero fps the other thing i tried was saving versions of the three two zero two four zero movie with preferred playback rates greater than one zero and seeing how well they played from within movieplayer ie with quicktime s normal synchronized playback a preferred rate of nine zero four five fps didn t work too well the playback was very jerky compare this with the raw speed test which achieved four five fps with ease i can t believe that quicktime s synchronization code would add this much overhead i think the slowdown was coming from the mac system s task switching a preferred rate of seven zero three five fps seemed to work fine i couldn t see any evidence of stutter at eight zero four zero fps i think i could see slight stutter but with four key frames every second it was hard to tell i guess i could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the key frames to make the stutter more noticeable of course this will also improve the compression slightly which should speed up the playback performance even more lawrence d oliveiro fone six four seven eight five six two eight eight nine computer services dept fax six four seven eight three eight four zero six six university of waikato electric mail ldo waikato ac nz hamilton new zealand three seven four seven two six s one seven five one nine seven e gmt one two zero zero
