 from idh nessie mcc ac uk ian hawkins subject making up odd resistor values required by filters organization manchester computing centre lines one four when constructing active filters odd values of resistor are often required i e something like a three one four k ohm resistor it seems best to choose common capacitor values and cope with the strange resistances then demanded is there a pd program out there that will work out how best to make up such a resistance given fixed resistors of the standard one two values per decade one one two one five one eight two two three three etc it is a common enough problem yet i cant recall seing a program that tells that rx ry rz gives rq starting with q and finding prefered values x y and z cheers ian h
