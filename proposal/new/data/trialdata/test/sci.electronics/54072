 from stephen dogmatix inmos co uk stephen collyer subject re lead acid batteries concrete organization inmos limited bristol uk lines four zero in article cph dmu ac uk chris hand writes carter ames camter two eight astro ocis temple edu wrote why does a lead acid battery discharge and become dead totally unuseable when stored on a concrete floor i think it s because the lead gets coated with lead oxide if the battery is not being charged or discharged i remember some advice from an ancient car manual guide my father had which was to use car batteries to power a garage clock or something similar when they re not in a car this is supposed to prevent the oxidation but i ve no idea if it really works the concrete floor connection is a red herring it could be that you stored it somewhere that it could become covered by moisture or damp air which would short out the terminals this may contribute to discharging but would be reversible the same thing happens to my car citroen two cv damp gets under the bonnet us hood and shorts the spark plugs to earth so it won t start the solution for the car is to clean the plug leads and spray with wd four zero moisture repellant if damp is the problem then storing the well this is off topic but back in the days when i used to drive bangers i never found wd four zero to do anything that wiping with a dry cloth did nt do i think the effectiveness of wd four zero is a myth invented by the guy who owns the company battery off the ground may help i m not sure if spraying with wd four zero would be safe since it is very flammable high percentage petroleum just a thought chris steve collyer
