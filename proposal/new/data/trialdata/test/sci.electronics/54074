 from ifarqhar laurel ocs mq edu au ian farquhar subject re atari two six zero zero processors organization macquarie university sydney australia lines four six nntp posting host laurel ocs mq edu au in article john gu uwa edu au john west writes ifarqhar laurel ocs mq edu au ian farquhar writes wrong it has a six five zero seven for those who would like to know the six five zero seven was a six five zero two without irq or nmi and with only one three address lines giving eight k memory space yes but still not a six five zero two for those differences same instruction set of course it had one custom chip not an asic in the sense that word is now understood the tia sometimes known as the six five two six although most other manufacturers list that as the cia complex interface adapter tia stands for television interface adapter and it handles sound paddles and the minimal video hardware the two six zero zero possessed didn t know about it being called the six five two six thats the cia found in the commodore six four i don t believe this chip existed when the two six zero zero was around yes the same number but an entirely different device i should have qualified this further by stating that this was the pal version of the tia i am not one zero zero sure that the ntsc tia would have a different number the tia was mapped into the bottom one two eight bytes of page zero and shadowed in the bottom one two eight bytes of page one to get an image on the screen you had to wait until the raster line your picture started at load bitmaps for this line into the sprite registers tell them what x positions to take how many duplicates you wanted etc then do it all again for the next line this took all of the processor s time during the visible portion of the display does anyone on the net actually have details of the tia as this is the only device i have not yet discovered details about atari australia when asked claimed that their attempts to get the programmers documentation for the two six zero zero had failed as the us head office had refused to provide it to chip selects the six five zero seven likes to have rom right at the top of memory so the two six zero zero had to use roms with active high chip selects not exactly normal so some cartriges had a seven four zero four in them to convert this to the more usual active low chip select i saw a couple of cheaper devices with pn two two two two s and a couple of resistors hooked up as a cheap inverter nasty but workable and cheaper than a seven four zero four inverter if labor costs almost nothing ian
