two eight astro ocis temple edu carter ames writes i thought the first thread was hilarious so here goes another post some more background information on what has happened to my poor batteries one year i left the batteries in the garage the garage is unheated they were left in their places that they needed to be one in the riding lawnmower what a lux and one in each motorcycle the battery in the riding lawnmower was about three four years old and one of the cycle batteries was new and one was around five years old upon spring time i discovered that all of the batteries were dead and needed to be recharged they all worked properly except for the older ones and they had to be replaced about halfway through the summer they had originally been stored in the garage and i think i remember my dad charging them in spring last year i decided to bring them in to the basement which has two parts one is dirt and brick and the other is concrete i brought in all three and discovered in the spring about one five days ago that not only were the batteries dead but when i put the charger on them the charger said hmmmmmmmm and the amp meter read around one zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero in other words it was pinned the internal circut tripped and i went on to the other batteries they were the same realizing that we still had two gigantic sailboat batteries also lead acid i decided to put the charger on them these had been sitting for around one and a half years on the brick and dirt part and noticed that they only needed a small charge around two hours or so on trickle i tested them by using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts and they worked fine for around two five of em this leads me to believe one of several things one i bought really tty batteries last year sorta true two the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the batteries three there was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the room where the concrete is four the dirt room was able to absorb the moisture in the air better than concrete btw i can almost waterski in the dirt room any other ideas could be the aliens anything is possible the lead acid secondary cell releases energy electricity with the following chemical reaction pb pbo two two h two so four two pbso four two h two zero lead and lead iv oxide and sulfuric acid produce lead sulfate and water the standard heats of formation at two five c seven seven f of the various compounds are heat of formation compound at two five c kcal mole pb zero zero zero pbo two six five zero h two so four one nine three six nine pbso four two one eight five h two zero six eight three one seven four the heat of reaction at two five c is therefore six zero six kcal per mole pbso four produced note that lead sulfate is not very soluble zero zero zero four eight grams per one zero zero grams water at two five c and it will thus precipitate out of solution where the reaction is occurring or the cathode positive terminal of the battery i am almost sure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms but i may be wrong oh well i don t have a corroded battery to corrobate and i don t feel like thinking through it right now what is important to notice here is that the reaction as you knew it would be is exothermic or energy discharging if moisture with dissolved electrolytes acid rain condenses on the battery a conductive path between the terminals may form this will discharge the battery as the chemical reaction proceeds the reaction is reversible if electricity from an alternator or battery charger is put back into the battery lead acid batteries must change in chemical composition to discharge each cell has all the reactants necessary for the reaction the non reacting posts terminals of the lead acid battery are there to remove or add electric energy during a discharge or charge because the reaction is exothermic it has a tendency to happen though quite slowly under normal circumstances so while keeping the battery dry is a good idea it is not a total solution to understand why lead acid batteries do indeed discharge faster when stored on concrete as opposed to wood or earth dirt one should recall lechatelier s principle which can be paraphrased as anything subjected to some stress will act to move to a more comfortable position here are the thermal conductivities of a some selected materials thermal conductivity material temperature c f btu hr ft ft f ft diatomaceous earth two zero four zero zero five one natural across strata eight

zero zero one one note that the thermal conductivity for dirt diatomaceous earth goes down with temperature also two zero four c is about four zero zero k and the values for earth powder are on the same order of magnitude as natural earth the thermal conductivity of concrete is around a factor of one zero greater than that of dirt and is two four times greater than wood it is these differences in thermal conductivity that cause the battery on concrete to discharge faster than that on dirt or wood at any instant the discharge reaction is occurring energy is being released either as electricity or heat thermal conductivity of air is about zero zero one five btu hr ft ft f ft during storage except for the trickle that passes through any condensate on the battery this energy is mostly released as heat the higher conductivity surface will remove the heat proportionately faster than the lower conductivity surface thus if you perfectly insulated a dry battery on all but the bottom surface at any given battery temperature above the storage surface temperature the battery on a concrete surface will be discharging about one zero times faster than that on dirt this is where lechatelier s principle comes into play removing energy from the exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion if the reaction normally occurs at room temperature keeping the battery at that temperature requires the removal of any heat produced a concrete surface is a better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface store a battery in the corner of a poured concrete basement and you have three surfaces removing energy which pulls the reaction along also if water evaporates from the battery that elevates the ratio of sulfuric acid to water this will tend to drive the discharge reaction jeff white jhwhit zero one ulkyvx louisville edu how do i get the ketchup out of my pocket protector french fries
