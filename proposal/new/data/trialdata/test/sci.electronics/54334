 from pmanson bnr ca peter manson subject re solvent for duct tape adhesive nntp posting host bcars three zero zero organization bell northern research ontario canada lines one six in article ruck beach cis ufl edu john ruckstuhl writes i know this is a long shot but does anyone know what solvent i should use to clean duct tape adhesive from carpet yet another suggestion but this one is non toxic although i would handle it like any other cleaner and it smells nice the chemical is called d limonene and it smells like lemon peels i think it is a lemon extract of some kind you might find it in a hardware store sold as a general purpose solvent but your best bet would be any bike store it is used as a chain cleaning fluid it works on sticker glue crayons grease oil etc it s clear yellow in the bottle and you can use it straight if you add water it changes to a creamy consistency which is good for some jobs peter
