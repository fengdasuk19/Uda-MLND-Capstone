 from vanderby mprgate mpr ca david vanderbyl subject re question on addressing nntp posting host chip reply to vanderby mprgate mpr ca david vanderbyl organization mpr teltech ltd lines three seven in article skelly amiganet chi il us sean kelly writes i have a question about accessing certain addresses on a chip particulary a two seven c five one two eprom although i don t know that much about it as i understand it there s a pin on the chip that when voltage is applied kicks up the address the question is how do you determine how many bytes the address is incremented by for example if i have code i want to be accessed at two zero zero zero and also at say four zero zero zero how do i move the address pointer to those positions thanks for any info sean kelly sysop amizon bbs three one two five nine four one one four six always looking for classic video games for the following systems atari two six zero zero atari five two zero zero colecovision atari five two zero zero intellivision vectrex judging by your sig you are trying to make some kind of game cartridge information of how to build an eeprom cartidge for the vectrex is available via anonymous ftp at csus edu since you ve chosen the two seven c five one two you are probably trying to make a multicart to do this simply one load the game images into the eeprom at two zero zero zero four zero zero zero etc your eeprom burner software may allow this or you will have to assemble the images into one file yourself with suitable gaps two wire up the cartridge with the lower address bits going to the game console and the high bits going to switches to choose between games to directly answer your question above the pin that kicks up the address is simply another address line for a concrete example with the two seven c five one two and eight k games images you would wire a zero a one two to the cartridge and a one three a one five to three switches the three switches would allow you to pick from the eight games on the eeprom
