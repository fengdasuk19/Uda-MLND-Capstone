 from camter two eight astro ocis temple edu carter ames subject lead acid batteries part two organization temple university lines four zero nntp posting host astro ocis temple edu x newsreader tin version one one pl eight i thought the first thread was hilarious so here goes another post some more background information on what has happened to my poor batteries one year i left the batteries in the garage the garage is unheated they were left in their places that they needed to be one in the riding lawnmower what a lux and one in each motorcycle the battery in the riding lawnmower was about three four years old and one of the cycle batteries was new and one was around five years old upon spring time i discovered that all of the batteries were dead and needed to be recharged they all worked properly except for the older ones and they had to be replaced about halfway through the summer they had originally been stored in the garage and i think i remember my dad charging them in spring last year i decided to bring them in to the basement which has two parts one is dirt and brick and the other is concrete i brought in all three and discovered in the spring about one five days ago that not only were the batteries dead but when i put the charger on them the charger said hmmmmmmmm and the amp meter read around one zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero zero in other words it was pinned the internal circut tripped and i went on to the other batteries they were the same realizing that we still had two gigantic sailboat batteries also lead acid i decided to put the charger on them these had been sitting for around one and a half years on the brick and dirt part and noticed that they only needed a small charge around two hours or so on trickle i tested them by using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts and they worked fine for around two five of em this leads me to believe one of several things one i bought really tty batteries last year sorta true two the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the batteries three there was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the room where the concrete is four the dirt room was able to absorb the moisture in the air better than concrete btw i can almost waterski in the dirt room any other ideas could be the aliens anything is possible
