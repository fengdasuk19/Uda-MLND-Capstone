 from schaerer isi ethz ch thomas schaerer subject re voltage regulation and current limiting organization swiss federal institute of technology eth zurich ch x newsreader tin version one one pl nine lines two one andy collins acollins uclink berkeley edu wrote one not so quick question to throw out there for you guys for our class project we need to design and build a power supply to the following specs voltatge adjustable from one one two v current limited at one a voltage must stay within two of designated value for i from zero one a ac ripple less than five mv rms to decide which kind of circuit you must know the initialprecission of the limiter current and the allowed temp drift in the first case you can use a ube of a transistor as a voltage reference of about zero seven vdc with a temp drift of two mv k in the second case its better you use a bandgap ref and a opamp circuit to detect the maximum current the output of this opamp controlls the outputstage to limit the current bye thomas
