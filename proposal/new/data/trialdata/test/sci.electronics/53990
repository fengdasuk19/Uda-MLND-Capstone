 from tgg otter hpl hp com tom gardner subject re can radio freq be used to measure distance organization hewlett packard laboratories bristol uk lines two four in sci electronics rgc three six seven nine bcstec ca boeing com robert g carpenter writes i m wondering if it s possible to use radio waves to measure the distance between a transmitter s and receiver yes it s called radar seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength and determine distance this would be for short distances two zero zero zero ft and i would need to have accuracy of six inches or so depends on the environment in a static environent such as a waveguide yes in a dynamic environment with objects moving about the multipath kills this concept how about measuring vertical distance as well any chance or am i getting ridiculous what is the difference between vertical and horizontal what frequencies would be best for this or does matter this depends on the required range the required accuracy the allowable ambiguity in range the frequencies the fcc etc allow you to use
