 from gsulliva enuxha eas asu edu glenn a sullivan subject re need help with video detection circuit summary build a cheap video detector organization arizona state university lines one nine verity jack sns com steve verity writes i am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video vs a blank screen by monitoring the r g and b outputs of a graphics card it should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at six five mhz which would mean detecting a one five ns pulse it should also be able to tell the difference between a blank screen about three zero zero mv and a dim screen say around three one zero mv oh yes it also needs to be cheap in fact the difference between completely black and completely white is only six five zero mv i am wondering if i am going to have to amplify the video signals to make this work try a differential amplifier put back to back diodes between the collectors restrict the voltage swing have one zero ma flow with five zero zero ohm collector rs and keep the stray c below one zero pf try two n five one seven nine s run collector to your logic allen sullivan
