 from cmh eng cam ac uk c m hicks subject re making up odd resistor values required by filters nntp posting host club eng cam ac uk organization cam eng lines two six idh nessie mcc ac uk ian hawkins writes when constructing active filters odd values of resistor are often required i e something like a three one four k ohm resistor it seems best to choose common capacitor values and cope with the strange resistances then demanded is there a pd program out there that will work out how best to make up such a resistance given fixed resistors of the standard one two values per decade one one two one five one eight two two three three etc it is a common enough problem yet i cant recall seing a program that tells that rx ry rz gives rq starting with q and finding prefered values x y and z i once wrote such a program in bbc basic it was very crude and took around five seconds to do an exhaustive search with a small amount of intelligence and told you the best combination rq and the best below rq if you want to write one just store the prefered values in an array and then search the solution space using three nested loops i m sure you could knock this up in an hour christopher christopher hicks paradise is a linear gaussian world cmh uk ac cam eng also reported to taste hot and sweaty
