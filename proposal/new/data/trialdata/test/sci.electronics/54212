 from squish endor uucp shishin yamada subject re atari two six zero zero processors organization aiken computation lab harvard university lines seven one in article ifarqhar laurel ocs mq edu au ian farquhar writes in article squish endor uucp shishin yamada writes the atari two six zero zero used a six five zero two cpu just like their entire eight bit line four zero zero eight zero zero one two zero zero one four zero zero one four four zero one three zero xe six five xe computers as well as the five two zero zero game machine wrong it has a six five zero seven sorry ian i haven t toyed with it in several years i haven t seen the insides in quite a few years i just saw the post lagging for quite a few days and thought i d toss in my zero zero two i assume the six five zero seven was functionally similar to the six five zero two was it also made by mos technologies i really am more versed in the six five zero two based atari computers the two six zero zero came later on the two six zero zero had some extra asic chips that were basically modified graphics chips and pia s for the joysticks it had one custome chip not an asic in the sense that word is now understood the tia sometimes known as the six five two six although most other manufacturers list that as the cia complex interface adapter tia stands for television interface adapter and it handles sound paddles and the minimal video hardware the two six zero zero possessed in the atari computers the cia chip you refer to sounds an awful lot like the ctia color television interface adapter chip used in the early models later atari upgraded this to the gtia graphics other colorful literature stated that the gtia might have stood for george the developer of the chip there was also a standard six five three two ram i o timer riot plus a voltage regulator and if memory serves a five five five timer that s all later model two six zero zero might have incorporated many of the chips into one asci as the weight of the machines and part count decreased a lot over the years not according to the servicing documentation i have here the two six zero zero did not change intenally very much at all funny i had an old and new model the old one was significantly heavier additionally i think the two six zero zero used two k four k and up to eight k of rom for their games roms were mapped into the upper four k of the six five zero seven s address space two k and four k games were fine but later eight k and one six k games needed bank switching atari and others made much of these huge cartridges i have no idea how much ram it had to work with but i would hazard a guess of two or four k ram sorry i am way out of line here my first microcontroller i built was a mc six eight seven zero one based chipset with one two eight bytes onboard that was not easy to work with in addtion to a small two k on board eprom wrong it had one two eight bytes of ram from the riot this was multiply mapped into both page zero pseudo registers and page one stack and also throughout the bottom four k of memory tia registers also sat in this address space as one two eight bytes of ram was somewhat limiting some later cartridges also carried ram themselves which was interesting as atari had provided no write line to the cart this was managed by mapping the reads from ram into one address range and the writes into another but all the time this scheme ate into the very scarce rom address space ian
