 from jkjec westminster ac uk shazad barlas subject re service indicator of a bmw organization university of westminster lines one eight derek there is a tool available to reset the service indicator on bmws but the lights will come back on after two three weeks the tool is in fact illegal in europe atleast it is often the case that the unsuspecting punter trots off to buy a used bmw and a few weeks later all the lights come on other than that i know of no other tool anyone else about changing oil every one five zero zero zero miles thats ok on newer audis they only require it after every one two zero zero zero miles i am talking about an oil change just a query do you drive your car very very carefully like no sudden acceleration etc if yeah then the one five zero zero zero m oil change seems quite reasonable but if you drive kinda fast i d get a bit up tight abot that one five zero zero zero thingy a point to note just because the first light came on at three k doesn t mean all the others will come on every three k too shaz
