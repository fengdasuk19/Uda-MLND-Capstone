 from mauritz c spcvxb spc edu subject weird problem with gm four banger transmission organization spc community access system lines three four i m having an interesting problem with my girlfriend s car before i delve into its innards i thought i d check net wisdom on the subject it s a one nine eight five buick skyhawk i know i know two zero l efi four banger auto three five k miles when i drive tha car long enough to get it hot especially at highways speeds the transmission has this nasty habit of getting stuck in three rd gear as a result when you stop for a light the motor stalls putting the car in park and waiting for three zero six zero seconds before restarting sometimes allows the transmission to reset and go back into one st otherwise it just stalls when put in drive my thoughts either it the three rd gear band is binding and getting stuck when it gets hot not so likely or perhaps the lock up converter is not disengaging properly seems likely the least likely keeping fingers crossed is that some critical vacuum hose has broken cracked and this behaviour is due to lack of vaccuum somewhere as used to happen with old modulator valves my background is that my father owns a service station and i worked there on and off from one zero one nine years of age please feel free to be as technical as you want i d appreciate hearing any tips suggestions offers of free beer skoal chris
