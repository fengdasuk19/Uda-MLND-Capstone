 from rjwade rainbow ecn purdue edu robert j wade subject re saturn extended warranty organization purdue university engineering computer network lines two six in article writes i agree with gaia even though the saturn has proved to be a very reliable car so far a little money spent now is worth the peace of mind this is an interesting point some people are not really buying the coverage they are buying peace of mind marketing folks love selling that i suggest that people choose to not engage their minds in peaceless worry rather than buying that peace of mind in my opinion getting the powertrain warranty is enough in my case that s be cause anything that needed repairing in the interior sunroof windows doors etc i could do myself i just didn t want to mess with the engine and such you d be surprised how much the little knick knack stuff can cost what if your a c goes out steering rack don t get me wrong i m against all extended warranties they are a ripoff plus i think the extra three years of two four hour roadside assistance must be worthe so meting i opted for the five year plan for three seven five extra three yrs you realize the first three yr three six k is free warranty that comes with the car thomas
