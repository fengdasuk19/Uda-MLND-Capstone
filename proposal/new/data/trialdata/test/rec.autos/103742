 from david ganglion ann arbor mi us david hwang subject re best radar detector valentine one organization d j services lines four three in article troy sequent com troy wecker writes let me explain why i feel the bogey counter feature is a gimmick radar waves bounce off objects especially metal that is how radar speed measurement works a high frequency microwave x band approx one zero ghz and k is approx two four ghz is sent out and reflected back to the antenna off of an automobile or other objects if an object is moving a doppler shift about three four hz per mph on x band occurs is measured and converted to miles per hour these waves bounce all over the place and they can reflect many times and go in many directions from what i understand the valentine one can only tell if these microwaves are coming from the front rear or both there are only two antennas if they are coming from both this in interpreted as a side bogey bogey counts are determined as sources by their relative strength to one another even if they are reflections of the same source i m certainly no engineer and really have no scientific basis on which to make this argument but don t you answer your own question is the reflected signal shifted at all from the act of being reflected if so wouldn t it then be easy for the detector to discriminate between reflections and direct sources here is the problem since the microwaves reflect how does the unit tell if it is a source or a reflection take a valentine one and drive to the local grocery store that uses an x band radar door opener you can tell by the small black box above the door pointed down at about a four five degree angle and your detector going off when it gets near the valentine one will count seven or eight bogeys from all directions front rear and sides it doesn t say which side the count changes as cars drive by and reflections change is there seven or eight sources not at the store i go to as i drive around with a standard detector i can only find one source and that is the door opener for the front door troy wecker troy sequent com sequent computer systems beaverton or david w hwang m d david ganglion ann arbor mi us
