 from amh two ns one cc lehigh edu alois m himsl subject re bmw five two eight i organization lehigh university lines four one in article adn six two eight five ritvax isc rit edu writes i looked at that bimmer yesterday it s an eight one has about nine zero kmi according to owner odometer stopped working at six eight kmi drivess well sounds good body is ok he wants three zero zero zero i liked the car despite it s auto tranny but my wife will be a primary driver on this one and she wants auto the radio does not work untill the car warms up and you honk the horn the a c seems to have a leak the sunroof is sticky but operational odometer does not work as mentioned before idle is a bit bouncy going from nine zero zero rpm to one two zero zero rpm wipers are slow that s teh gripes the owner says that he changed radiator alternator rotors and calipers exhaust the biggest problem is that the owner is a shifty sob telling strange stories i hate that i would never buy from a persom like that except how often you see a descent five two eight i for that amount of money he also said that although i could bring a mechanicin he wouldn t let me check the car by taking it to a garage suspicious and who knows what milage is on it so let me know what to check for given there s practically no rust i know there was an article on five two eight i in r d a few years back anybody remembers what issue mike s don t buy it all of the things you mentioned will just give you headaches later on also it sounds like the car needs a lot of work and as you probably know bmw s are not cheap to fix either the owner sounds like a shady character just trying to take advantage of someone sure three zero zero zero sounds good but you should calculate how much the repairs will be it sounds like you would have to sink in at least one zero zero zero to get everything fixed if not more also never trust anyone as far as mileage is concerned who knows how many miles are on it and how it was driven sure people tell you bmw s hold up but you have to consider any car is subject to wear and tear for all you know it could have two zero zero zero zero zero miles on it the thing you have to remember is that this isn t the last five two eight i around either just wait and keep shopping for around five zero zero zero six zero zero zero you can probably find one that is better needs less repair and has legitimate mileage unlike the one you are considering take it from a guy who has been taken a couple of times good luck al himsl
