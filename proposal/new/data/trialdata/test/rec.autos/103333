 from tgardner athena mit edu timothy j gardner subject re the one nine nine four mustang organization massachusetts institute of technology lines four seven nntp posting host pesto mit edu in article bqueiser magnus acs ohio state edu brian j queiser writes on the subject of the upcoming new mustang i do not put much stock in the mag rags inside information or even ford rep quotes the taurus was pretty much a surprise when it was finally disclosed in it s entirety inside information had the taurus with a v eight and rear wheel drive at one point i wouldn t look for a simple re paneled mustang folks you may be cheating yourself if you do there s a lot of potential ford hasn t released a new car without a four wheel is in seven years the mustang project has been brewing for at least four right a four wheel is could happen those modular v eight s are out there too in the interest of cafe and competition don t rule those out either your ignorant if you do and there are so many spy shots and artist renderings out there who really knows what it ll look like the mach iii doubt it highly the next mustang will be ford s highest profile car it attracts way more attention than the camaro firebird because it s heritage is more embedded in the general public don t lie to yourself and believe ford will forfeit that the car magazines have printed a lot of information about the new mustang and the consensus about what to believe in my car circle is that the suspension pieces and tuning will be almost identical to the current cobra but on a stiffer body structure which will improve its behavior after the mn one two thunderbird cost and weight debacle ford decided independent rear suspension with rear wheel drive won t be tried again in a volume car the current four nine l v eight will soldier on for about two years a version of the three two valve modular v eight in the mark viii could be offered then ford is spending big money tooling up for two five l and three five l v six engines which will power most of their cars in the immediate future and therefore probably do not consider volume production of three zero zero hp v eight engines a priority undisguised the car looks ok but not nearly as exciting as the new camaro firebird imo i suspect ford will produce their car with higher quality than gm will achieve with the camaro firebird the way gm loses money the temptation to just get them out the door for the sake of positive cash flow will be great once demand really takes off tim gardner
