 from cerulean access digex com bill christens barry subject two camrys eating clutch master cyls organization express access online communications greenbelt md usa lines three six nntp posting host access digex net summary why the repeated leaks keywords clutch master cyl problems i have both an eight four and an eight six camry each with manual five speed transmissions the eight four has about one zero five zero zero zero miles on it and the eight six about eight three zero zero zero miles about a year ago i found that the master cylinder on the clutch in the eight four was leaking fluid around the piston seal leading to air in the system and fluid back into the passenger compartment of the car i pulled the plunger and got a rebuild kit new plunger seal etc and thought i had the problem licked much to my surprise the same problem developed several months later this time i looked carefully at the master cylinder to make sure there were no scratches burrs or other obvious causes of the problem i didn t find any ever since i have been periodically feeding the clutch hydraulins additional fluid and bleeding air from the system i knew i would be selling the car and didn t want to go all the way to solving the problem i should add that the clutch is original and that i ve had to adjust the pedal to allow maximum extension of the piston into the master cylinder in order to actuate the clutch my hypothesis is that this means that when fully depressing the clutch pedal the angle of the piston rod attached to the pedal is off the axix of the cylinder thus cocking the piston and seal and perhaps deforming it what do you think of that as an explanation can you suggest a possible fix short of replacing the master cylinder and getting a new clutch put in now the eight six same problem except that the above diagnosis doesn t explain why all of the fluid leaked out by way of the master cylinder into the passenger compartment while i was on vacation for one zero days during which the clutch pedal was not depressed or otherwise caused to distort what can you suggest here many thanks let s hope i don t end up going to click and clack on this bill christens barry cerulean access digex com
