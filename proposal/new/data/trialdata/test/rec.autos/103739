 from johnn eskimo com john navitsky subject re ford probe opinions centered around the gt organization eskimo north two zero six three six seven three eight three seven seattle wa lines one three two in article heiser acs two bu edu bill heiser writes in article chuck eos ncsu edu chuck kesler writes jeremy g mereness says can anyone offer any opinions of the ford probe ala how they do in the long run repair records reliability mileage etc i ve found mine nine three probe gt to do quite well window problem deleted artical has been trimmed i have had my probe looked at twice by my local dealer where i purchased the car the first time they made this problem worse the second time after advising them of the service bulletin mentioned on my ford probe mailing list they said they didn t know of the bulletin they adjusted the window and made it much better however it now makes a scritch scritch noise on rough roads and still squeals when i open close the window in wet weather anyone elses s do this i ve not had any of the air or leakage problems that have been reported but do get the squeal that bill describes i live in seattle so the wet weather may be a factor ford only gives one key with the car c mon ford spend an extra few pennies if i recall correctly i got two keys horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference you ve got to position the fingers perfectly to make it beep buttons are terrible this is true i m wondering if this may be a safety concern ie if people pound on the place where the airbag lives speaking of the horn i was surprised to find that the probe comes with one of those nice merican sounding horns instead of the japanese sounding kind the previous probes had japanese horns no opinion transmission the five speed is a must i have always been a five speed guy almost every car i ve ever owned has been a five speed because i got a good deal on this car with the two five zero zero miles i knowingly overlooked the fact that it has an automatic but it is a pretty high tech automatic it is a fully electronicaly controlled four speed with the five speed is much more fun we opted for the automatic for a number of reasons but it s still fun and in some ways more practical no shake rattle noises when going over bumps potholes still ditto shakes and rattles has been my main gripe i ve gotten them to fix the worst of them but i fear that with the rather harsh ride the car will be a virtual potpouri of rattles when it gets older i too would suspect that this may be true tires two two five five five vr one six goodyear eagles seven zero left hoping for three zero k very very very well it sticks to the road like glue even on a rough surface yes interior is very very nice too very pleasing to the eye and ergonomically sound definitely ford mazda did a very very nice job on this one the car has a much more expensive than it actually is look and feel to it ditto yes this car s stiff suspension isn t for everyone i personally like it but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car i d strongly suggest looking into the mx six agree check it out i don t mind it but would say that if it was much stiffer it might be a problem how about the nine three r one rx seven for suspension well i wouldn t encourage passenger carrying in the probe unless the person in the front seat likes to sit with his knees to the dash as mentioned in the consumer reports write ups consider the back seat as a parcel shelf no biggie to me though if it had been i d not have bought the car but it s definitely not a family car true i ve heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine i haven t heard about this one i know that some of the very early probes eight nine and maybe nine zero had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers which i ve had this problem and read about it or at least i assume the one i had was the one i read about in any case what happened was the weld between the muffler and the pipe feeding it ok so i m not a mechanic broke in my case the dealer welded it ordered replacement parts and put them on when they got them i suspect this is some sort of one design flaw or two production flaw in any case i have an earlier model and would expect it to be worked out on newer ones in any case it is a warrantee repair or they get the keys back from what i ve heard it sounds like ford mazda had some qc problems with the probe and probably mx six when they first went into production but i think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point that s almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this though i have to agree that they seem to have some qc problesm but i seriously feel the car design is sound and expect it to do very well i second this there seems to be some things that slipped through but the car seems very sound while not perfection what is you get an awful lot for your money bill heiser heiser acs bu edu heiser world std com
