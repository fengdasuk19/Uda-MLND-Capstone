 from brad buck viewlogic com bradford kellogg subject re changing oil by self originator brad buck nntp posting host buck organization viewlogic systems inc lines two nine in article john foster writes i find this method much better myself too although i do really hate it when the bolt finally comes loose and the wrench and my hand both come crashing into my face after coming to which is about one five minutes later i change my clothes because by this time all the oil has drained on me and ice my entire face and suck down about two zero tylenol to ease the pain later in the day i then proceed with refilling the engine oil it s just crazy how i try and change the oil on my cars in one weekend i go through about three bottles of tylenol and two bags of ice oh that s not so bad every time i try to change the oil i forget to shut off the engine first the hot oil comes out and scalds me blinds me then the engine starts to overheat and while i m screaming in agony and trying to crawl out from under the car i grab the red hot exhaust pipe and get third degree burns on my hands my screams intensify as i finally emerge from under the car and i struggle to my feet in front of the car whereupon the radiator hose ruptures and sprays me with super heated coolant then the engine seizes but not before the cylinder head explodes piercing my flesh with fragments of red hot iron this happens every time i m starting to think i should pay the mechanic two five instead paying the hospital two five zero zero zero zero and the dealer two five zero zero zero for a new car this gets costly when you change the oil every three zero zero zero miles toadface
