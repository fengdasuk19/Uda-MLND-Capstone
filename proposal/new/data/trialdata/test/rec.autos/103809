 from rjwade rainbow ecn purdue edu robert j wade subject re saturn extended warranty organization purdue university engineering computer network lines two one in article login austin ibm com writes i ve owned a saturn for and year and a half and didn t have the extended warranty but just traded it in for a one nine nine three for reasons that i won t mention unless someone wants to know i opted for the five year six zero zero zero zero mile extended with five zero deductible it s sorta like buying health insurance you could say that you re not sick now and haven t been sick for a while but you can t guarantee that you won t be sick tomorrow a little money invested today is better than being sick tomorrow and now being able to pay for it or having to pay a lot more tomorrow than you can today justify all you want extended warranties are a ripoff high profit item for the dealer and you didn t buy five yr six zero k you get three yr three six k free so what you bought is two yr two four k and you still have to pay five zero every time you use this great warranty better to put your money in the bank and use it for repairs if when you need it considering that your last car was only one five years old are you sure you will even keep this new one past it s free warranty period btw typical profit on extended warranties is around eight zero that s right only two zero of the money needs to go into the collective pot to pay for any future repairs that the group of extended warranty people collect
