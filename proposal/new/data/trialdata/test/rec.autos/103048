 from jmh hopper virginia edu jeffrey hoffmeister subject re questions about insurance companies esp geico organization itc uva community access unix internet project distribution usa lines two five in article wlsmith valve heart rri uwo ca wayne smith writes in article davew cs umd edu david g wonnacott writes i m considering switching to geico insurance but have heard that they do not assign a specific agent for each policy or claim i was worried that this might be a real pain when you make a claim i have also heard that they try to get rid of you if you have an accident i ve read in this group that geico has funded the purchasing of radar guns by police depts i m not sure where geico has purchased radar guns in several states i know they have done it here in ct i have also heard horror stories about people that have been insured by geico for years and then had one accident and were immediately dropped and once you ve been dropped by any insruance company you become labled a high risk and end up forking out three or four times what you should be for insurance my suggestion stay where you are or shop around but stay away from geico jeff
