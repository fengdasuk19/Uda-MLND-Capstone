 from alane microsoft com alan ezekiel subject re the dayton gun buy back re boston gun buy back organization microsoft corporation lines six three lvc cbnews cb att com larry cipriani writes according to wnci nine seven nine fm radio this morning dayton ohio is operating a gun buy back they are giving five zero for every functional gun turned in they ran out of money in one day and are now passing out five zero vouchers of some sort they are looking for more funds to keep operating another media event brought to you by hci is there something similar pro gun people can do for example pay one zero zero to anyone who lawfully protects their life with a firearm sounds a bit tacky but hey whatever works as david veal points out this sort of promotion would be used against gun owners by the mass media however here is my proposal offer gun safety classes in your area free as a community service such a class would normally cost four zero or five zero so offering it free is a good promotion our gun club has organized several of these we just finished teaching another one last night in fact and they have been very well received we get a lot of people who are novices interested in guns we even get a few who are anti gun but feel they should know something about gun safety since members of their family keep guns at home teaching such a course gives us many desirable benefits one we have the chance to teach gun safety rules this increases firearm awareness and may help to reduce gun accident stats two a gun safety class is politically correct and likely to be viewed positively by the public and the media three most of the students are normal people not gun enthusiasts and this kind of class gives us the chance to give them a gentle introduction to firearms four some of the students are enthusiastic and will purchase a gun and become more involved in shooting or personal defense five it improves the public perception of our club and gun owners in general our students see that we are all reasonable non aggressive soft spoken people which helps to mitigate the standard image of a hardcore gun owner even anti gun students sometimes tell us they have something new to think about with regards to personal gun ownership six sharing our experience with others is a lot of fun our course is the standard nra certified home firearm safety class and our students pay only five for materials we also teach the nra s personal protection class although the cost is higher for that one since we have to purchase range time i think firearms safety classes are an excellent response to gun buy backs alane nobody shares my opinions i am a jelly doughnut especially not my employer president john f kennedy
