csuohio edu writes gun buyback programs will hopefully have an impact on accidental shootings especially youths domestic disputes where a gun is available in the heat of emotion and anger and maybe keep a few guns from being stolen and later used in street level crime what gives you the idea that gun buyback programs will have an impact on any of these things evidence please please don t misinterret what i was saying joe i was making the point tha there is no evidence of effect of gun buyback programs but hopefully if there is any effect it may prevent injuries or deaths in one of these types of common incidents if you re a research associate in urban child research then perhaps you can comment for us on the ratio of the accidental gun death rate to the rate of accidental death from other single causes follow that perhaps with some sort of justification for the amount of effort that anti gunners spend trying to convince the country that accidental gun related death among children in the u s is a serious problem firearms are the fifth leading cause of unintentional deaths among children ages one four and under i don t understand how the ratio to other accidental deaths is important so guns don t kill as many children as car accidents what is the difference in severity between one zero zero zero deaths and one zero zero zero zero deaths i am not trying to use accidental gun related deaths among children as a justification for gun control who needs to be convinced that accidental gun deaths of children is a serious problem i assumed that any humane person would be concerned when any one zero year old got hold of their parents gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends any death is serious wanna discuss match control firearms related unintentional deaths among children ages one four and under are the fault of one or more negligent persons not the gun did i say that a child who unintentionally shoots someone is not negligent no i hate to repeat myself jim but like i told joe i was not attempting in any way to justify gun control you re right any death is serious that was my point to joe who said that anti gunners try to convinve the country that accidental gun deaths related to children are a serious problem i guess i assumed everyone thought that it was a problem no i don t want to discuss match control i don t equate a book of matches to a loaded nine millimeter either don t confuse the issue and please don t say that tired old nra line guns don t kill people people kill people sure people can kill people without guns but easy access to guns makes it a lot more convenient guns don t kill people people with easy access to guns kill people more than anything gun buyback programs are symbolic offerings to the community in that sense i think they might do a little good please explain why you think symbolic offerings do good my point was gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police departments might i stress might do a little i stress little good by giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way overall i thought that i had made it clear that i did not think that gun buyback programs were useful providing false hope then is the intent jim i m just saying how it is i m not saying if that is a good thing or not from the police who i have talked with who run some of these gun buyback programs i get the impression that they really think they are having an impact on the community when i ask them if they have an evaluatory component to the program they say well no so in answer to your question no false hope is not the intent i think the intent is to show folks that police are attempting to do something to curb interpersonal gun violence whether its effective or not look if you can t measure the impact of these programs using some sort of pre test and post test evaluation what is the point it must be symbolic in nature the police are essentially saying look if you have a gun lying around and you don t want it we ll give you five zero for it because we care about the community if you i and joe could think of a way to measure the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of these programs we could become rich and famous i do know that the vast majority of guns that are used by youths or brought to school by youths on a daily basis about one three five zero zero zero youths are obtained easily and quickly through a personal friend or more often borrowed from a parent without their knowledge i suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these statistics i suspect you ll find if you look carefully that one three five zero zero zero is the number of students estimated to have carried a weapon not necessarily a gun to school at least once in the past year and not the number of students who carry a gun to school daily well joe i suggest that you talk to the center to prevent handgun violence or the centers for disease control if you look carefully you will see that you greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths the cphv reports that one three five zero zero zero youth bring guns to school daily and that four zero zero zero zero zero bring guns to school at least once a year the cdc estimates that one out zero f two five high school students carried a gun to school at least once in one nine nine zero the cdc also says that one two million elementary aged latch key children kids who come home from school to an empty house have access to guns in their home california schools reported a two zero zero increase in student gun confiscations between one nine eight six and one nine nine zero and a four zero increase between one nine eight eight and one nine nine zero florida reported a six one percent increase in gun incidents in schools between one nine eight six eight seven amd one nine eight seven eight eight these are the statistics two zero zero increase in california schools eh gun control is working fine there i didn t anything about gun control what are you talking about thus willing to follow a man who claimed to be the messiah got news for you folks if the big cheese was on this crazy planet of ours presently he would not be carrying a gun or holding children when they were in danger holding kids time for a reality check son these kids were the children of the people inside who believed that the forces of evil were outside waiting to kill them would you send your children out the door if you believed as they did okay maybe i worded it wrong dad i meant that to put children in a situation fortified compound where harm could come to them is not the act of a messiah in my opinion i m not saying that koresh had control over these children directly but i would hope that whatever messiah there is would not let innocent children die if as he claimed he was the messiah and people followed him as such why did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them burn alive thanks for the reality check joe its been real so your religion is different does that make it his wrong even assuming koresh actually made that decision and the verdict is still out on that jim listen to me i said i m not religious whatsoever do you understand religion has nothing to do with this i could care less what religion they were okay to put children in that situation is wrong pure and simple difference is good jim i am the most progressive and diverse person in the world but if different is allowing kids to be exposed to tanks and tear gas then yes jim different is wrong
