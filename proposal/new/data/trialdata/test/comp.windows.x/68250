 from brown ftms uucp vidiot subject re viewing postscript files under x windows reply to brown ftms uucp vidiot organization vidiot s other hangout lines three zero in article gordons mon sps mot com gordon sasamori writes brown ftms uucp vidiot writes ow three zero is the same but the definition of broken is relative pageview requires dsc compliant postscript files in order to stop at page breaks i don t consider that broken i say that any program that puts out a postscript file that isn t dsc compliant is broken well that may be true however the man page for pageview for ow two zero does not mention about dsc compliance in any event the point here is that if you try to display some ps files using pageview you will find out that it s not a practical tool it is true that the man page for pageview does not say that the files need to be dsc compliant that is the fault of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing at sun i was informed by a sun employee that the pageview program does require dsc compliant postscript there was the possibility that it was going to be changed so that if the file wasn t dsc compliant that it would stop at each showpage i believe that this method would preclude being able to go backwards and forwards through the file i e you could only go forward to the next showpage this isn t in ow three zero pageview but maybe it is in the solaris two x version of ow ow three one in any event i find pageview extremely useful since all of the postscript that i produce is dsc compliant i don t have any problems harvard ucbvax uwvax astroatc ftms brown or uu two psi com ftms brown rutgers internet brown wi extrel com or ftms brown astroatc uucp cs wisc edu
