appropriate manuals listed in the bibliography below before posting to the comp windows open look comp windows x or alt toolkits xview newsgroups and or their corresponding mailing lists special notes i have not updated this faq for the recently announced openwindows four due to ship later this year yes sun is moving to motif along with all of cose but the motif to which they move will be a new motif with some of the open look ui features added yes openwindows four will use dps instead of news news is dead this means tnt is dead too xview and olit will be supported but probably not enhanced after the next release i don t know if there will be a source release of xview three one or not the cose environment will include at least some of sun s deskset ported to motif look for calendar manager and mailtool at least yes the new mailtool will be mime compliant frequently asked questions for x one one are posted to comp windows x monthly this is version revision one four eight last

a graphical user interface gui a gui determines the look and feel of a system the shape of windows buttons and scroll bars how you resize things how you edit files etc the open look gui is specified developed and maintained jointly by sun microsystems and at it used a widget set and was probably the easiest for people who were already x one one xt programmers to learn you could buy the source from at it is also often included in system v release four it was written in c the release of olit in openwindows three zero was olit three zero olit support passed to usl then a division of at release three contains some incompatibilities with tnt one zero and tnt two zero but sun are committed to supporting the api at least until they stop news support some time later this year and replace it with display postscript wail you might ask what is committed to means in this context the answer seems to be that it means absolutely nothing sun currently asserts that it is committed to olit however the c user interface toolkit uit consists of an object oriented c class library layered on top of xview and a tool to generate code from devguide three gil files the uit also includes features that simplify event management and the use of postscript and color it is said to be compatible with openwindows v two and v three and presumably v three zero one since the release mentions that it works on solaris two uit is not an official sun supported product but an ongoing project of various people within sun it can be found on export lcs mit edu in the mit contrib directory as uitv two tar z use binary mode where does motif fit in it doesn t motif is an alternative graphical user interface that is being developed by osf it has a look and feel reminiscent of microsoft windows and the os two presentation manager there are no non commercial motif toolkits available although the motif source is sold reasonably cheaply by osf although motif is currently available on more platforms than openwindows the open look gui is almost certainly used on many more machines simply because sun and sysvr four have such a large installed base sun s cd ware volume two contains a roadmap for improving motif applications by converting them to olit there are also notes in the periodic table olit demo openwinhome demo olittable what is moolit moolit is a version of olit from at dps is also available on more kinds of machine performance on our rs six zero zero zero is not suitable for interactive work what it will be like on the sparcstation remains to be seen note that whereas x news fonts are shared by both subsystems the dps extension to x does not make type one postscript fonts available to ordinary x one one programs it is not like atm on a pc in this regard there is at least one third party version which does make fonts available however subject window managers olwm olvwm what are olwm and olvwm they are window managers a window manager is the part of the x window system e g x one one that is responsible for deciding how to lay out windows on the screen and for managing the user s interaction with the windows olwm is the standard open look window manager it s included with all of the openwindows q v implementations and you can also get the source by ftp since sun donated it olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a virtual desktop hence the v in its name it shows a little map on the screen with the currently displayed area represented by a little rectangle you can move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow keys this lets you run several clients applications and move the display around from one to the other olvwm was derived from the openwindows three zero olwm by scott oaks you need to have xview three zero to compile it get olvwm from an ftp site such as export lcs mit edu in the contrib directory there are three patches can i use my favorite window manager with openwindows instead of olwm yes if you use twm for example or mwm you won t be able to use the pin and unpin feature of olwm and you probably won t see the footers some windows use to display certain messages if you use twm you ll want to use the f delete function to unpin menus and get rid of programs that don t have a quit button when not run under olwm for twm put this in your home twmrc lefttitlebutton target f delete where target is a one six x one six icon from usr include x one one bitmaps alternatively try add a menu to each window managed by twm or tvtwm lefttitlebutton menu f menu ol menu menu ol menu for mwm you can double click on the menu icon on the left of the title bar to dismiss a pop up window i am told see the manual page for your window manager twm etc subject openwindows terminals and other displays can i use olwm and olvwm without openwindows or on an x terminal the openwindows xnews server combines sunview news postscript and x one one this means that it can run programs compiled for any of those systems unfortunately it means that some openwindows programs need either news or sunview support and thus won t run on an x terminal this includes pageview in particular you can use olwm or olvwm see above on an x terminal or a non open windows display and most open look clients e g olit or xview ones will work perfectly well you may find that you get complaints about fonts not being found if so see the fonts section below if you are running the window manager built in to an ncd terminal you may have problems with input focus setting input true in the terminal s xdefault file in usr lib x one one xdm may or may not help subject configuration files getting started with openwindows what configuration files do i need to know about xinitrc and xsessionrc the first time you run openwindows a xinitrc file will be created in your login directory home if it already exists you might have to edit it somewhat it s simplest to move it and any other old x one one files you have to another directory and then merge the old and new files if your site uses xdm you should use xsession instead of xinitrc since xdm doesn t look at your xinitrc file openwin init openwin menu and openwin sys these are optional files you can create in your home directory depending on which version of olwm or olvwm you use look in openwinhome lib normally usr openwin lib for these files without the leading and copy any you want to change you may need to edit your xinitrc to get them recognized if you are not on an x terminal you will want to run a console window such as cmdtool c shelltool c xterm c or chuck musciano s contool program so that system output will be directed there instead of writing over your screen note that openwin sys is not executed unless you edit xinitrc xdefaults you can put x windows resource specifications in here in particular it is a good idea to include at least openwindows focuslenience true input true these allow non icccm compliant programs to receive input even if they forget to ask for it props the program that runs when you select properties from the default root menu under olwm or olvwm writes your choices into xdefaults don t put comments in xdefaults since props deletes them startup ps this is the news user profile file read by openwindows actually xnews on startup this is documented in the news programming manual near the back the most useful thing to put here is postscript code to change the keyboard repeat rate although you must be very careful since a syntax error in the postscript means that xnews will either not start up at all or will get broken in strange ways the news manual gives code that is both incorrect and insufficient warning things in this file rarely work on both openwindows two and three note that the mouse speed is best set in your xinitrc with xset m see the man page for xset man xset and xset help for more information here s what home startup ps should look like if you want a delay of about a third of a second three zero zero zero zero zero microseconds and a repeat rate of twenty or so keys per second three zero zero zero zero microseconds between repeats for openwindows three you ll have to experiment a bit because the repeattime is the delay between keys sent and thus doesn t include the time to process each key which is probably higher on my four one one zero than on your supersparc one zero five one gti injection again this is for openwindows three don t want the demos see p xxxii of news toolkit reference manual includedemos false def userprofile begin keyrepeatthresh zero three zero zero zero zero zero timeval storetimeval def keyrepeattime zero three zero zero zero zero timeval storetimeval def note three zero zero zero zero zero and three zero zero zero zero differ greatly end you must also have a user ps file in the same directory like this news three zero findpackage beginpackage tntcore three zero findpackage beginpackage tnt three zero findpackage beginpackage classrepeatkeys pop force repeat ps to autoload endpackage endpackage endpackage if you change these parameters you can test them without restarting the openwindows server like this psh i startup ps welcome to x one one news version three psh i welcome to x one one news version three classinit classrepeatkeys send now press control d you can also either of these two files startup ps and user ps to make the root window be retained so that a postscript drawing on the background won t be erased when you move windows frambuffer retained true put will do this note that this may increase the amount of memory used by the news server xnews dramatically see also trouble shooting it won t let me type trouble shooting is there an easy way to edit xdefaults environment variables how can i configure open look for a left handed mouse and keyboard you can use xmodmap to change the mouse buttons but be prepared for one or two occasional surprises see also man seven xview for a list of keybindings you can change at least for xview programs with openwindows two zero you can use defaultsedit to set the mouse mappings and then let sunview handle them the status returned by svenv should tell you whether your server is running under sunview or not put this in your xinitrc if eval svenv env then xmodmap e pointer one two three input from defaults else xmodmap e pointer three two one fi how can i get the screen to go blank when the system is idle run screenblank from etc rc local if you can it s a boring but effective screen saver see man screenblank under solaris two you ll need to copy screenblank from an older system as it s not supplied then add a new file in etc rc two d to make the system run screenblank automatically subject key bindings cut and paste how do i cut and paste between xterm and openwindows programs to go from xterm to textedit say select the text you want to copy by dragging the select mouse button in xterm press copy in the xterm this key is l six or meta c the o reilly xview manual gets this wrong move to the textedit window and press paste l eight or meta v if this doesn t work see trouble shooting cut and paste to go the other way from textedit to xterm select the text in textedit no need to use copy move to the xterm window and press adjust the middle mouse button you can also use the copy cut and paste buttons copy paste is boring what short cuts are available quick copy within textedit mailtool etc click select to get a text caret where you want the copied text to go press and hold down the paste or cut button select the text you want to copy move you ll see that it s underlined or crossed out as appropriate in the jed demo it goes grey let go of the paste or cut button the text you underlined or crossed out appears at the insert caret drag and drop to move a selection select the text you want to copy or move by dragging or multiple clicking the select or adjust mouse button put the mouse pointer anywhere within the selection press and hold down down the select mouse button and move the mouse pointer a little to the right you ll see the cursor changes to be the first three letters of the text or some other icon still holding select down move the mouse over the point where you want to drop the text you may see the mouse pointer change to a rifle sight or target to show that it s ok to drop things here let go of select and the text is moved this works in text fields of dialogue boxes as well as in text subwindows drag and drop to copy a selection this is the same as using drag and drop to move a selection except that you must hold the control key down as well as the select mouse button what are the default key bindings in textedit and elsewhere see the man page for textedit one for some of them in general the editing moving commands go in the opposite direction when shifted e g ctrl w deletes a word and ctrl w deletes the word to the right of the insert point meta i include file meta f find selection forward backward ctrl a start of line ctrl forward word ctrl w delete word ctrl u delete to start end of line ctrl return move to end start of document see the o reilly xview reference manual for a list of some of the default keys see also the olwm or olvwm manual page what can i put in my ttysrc where is it documented see the manual page for shelltool subject applications finding out contact sunsoft or sun and ask for the catalyst open look guide which lists over two zero zero pages of applications and also the huge catalyst listing of products for suns updated six monthly sun s free cdware cd roms each contain demo versions of several popular open look applications often you can simply contact the vendor concerned to have the license upgraded from demo and receive the full product documentation sunpics produces a cd rom for newsprint users printer s pallate which contains newsprint drivers for a variety of printers and plotters as well as six zero zero scaleable fonts that you can license there is a separate faq posting in comp windows open look that lists a number of free and commercial aplications mail lee sq com for a copy including open look ui application list in the subject for a faster reply subject deskset mailtool calendar manager etc is there a tty based interface to cm calendar manager yes cm delete cm insert and cm lookup these all have manual pages if man cm delete doesn t work or gives strange messages see under trouble shooting strange error messages below how can i arrange to have my signature included in my outgoing mail the best way is cd cp usr lib textswrc chmod w textswrc edit textswrc use vi textedit or whatever you prefer add the follwing key right three filter cat signature you might need to change to home now pressing r three will insert your signature file subject fonts does openwindows support type one postscript fonts yes under either solaris two zero or two one i m not sure which or not yet in other words if you have framemaker there is a utility to import them i m told the five seven fonts supplied with openwindows are fully hinted though and comparing them to the microsoft windows and apple truetype fonts is interesting the f three font format is described in a publication from the sun openfonts group listed in the bibliography below documentation on the unbundled version of typescaler is also available from sun openfonts you can buy f three fonts from sunpics monotype linotype urw and probably other major foundries sunpics newsprint software supports type one fonts improving font rendering time although the sun type renderer typescaler is pretty fast it s not as fast as loading a bitmap you can pre generate bitmap fonts for sizes that you use a lot and you can also alter and access the font cache parameters if you have a lot of memory you might want to increase the font cache size psh i welcome to x one one news version three bembo two zero fb chars parameter greater than number of characters supplied ls bembo two zero afb bembo two zero fb synonyms list bldfamily bembo bembo ff encoding latin cat compat list no such file or directory xset fp pwd xset fp rehash if you want the server to see your new font directory every time add this directory to your fontpath environment variable in one of your start up files e g login or profile converting between font formats convertfont etc you can also use folio fonts with an x one one server by converting them to a bitmap x one one bdf format first your licence forbids you from using the fonts on another machine and unless you have newsprint you shouldn t use them for printing having said all that you can use makeafb and convertfont to generate bdf files that you can compile with bdftosnf or bdftopcf use mftobdf from the seetex distribution to convert tex pk fonts to x one one bdf format which you can then use with either x one one or oenwindows you can also use der mouse s getbdf to get bdf fonts from a running x display server ftp larry mcrcim mcgill edu one three two two zero six one one x getbdf xview olit fonts at one zero zero dpi there aren t any more precisely the various text fonts such as lucida typewriter sans are available at one zero zero dpi and in fact are scalable under openwindows the glyph fonts are bitmaps and don t scale very well subject trouble shooting strange error messages no manual entry for cm lookup if man doesn t seem to find openwindows commands even though you are running openwindows try setting the manpath environment variable manpath openwinhome share man usr man export manpath or setenv manpath openwinhome share man usr man for csh users openwinhome should be usr openwin on most systems window window creation failed to get new fd window base frame not passed parent window in environment cannot create base frame process aborted these messages all come from sunview programs sunview was an earlier windowing system for suns and was not networked some of the sunview programs are still around in usr bin and have names that are the same as their openwindows counterparts you almost certainly want to run the programs in openwinhome instead set your path so that openwinhome bin and openwin bin xview for openwindows two come before bin or usr bin they re the same or you ll get the sunview versions of mailtool cmdtool shelltool etc memory fault core dumped if you get this from the binder or if binder vanishes suddenly get the following patches one zero zero four nine three zero two binder one zero zero five two four zero three cetables one zero zero six two six zero three tooltalk trouble compiling xt xmu or olit programs get wmshellwidgetclass if you are using openwindows three zero x one one r four based xt contact your local sun office and request the following patches one zero zero five one two zero two four one x openwindows three zero libxt jumbo patch one zero zero five seven three zero three four one x openwindows three zero undefined symbols when using shared libxmu if you can t install the patch a workaround is to add u get wmshellwidgetclass u get applicationshellwidgetclass on the link ld or cc o line an alternative is to add assert nodefinitions to cflags in your makefile or even in imake tmpl subject trouble shooting it won t let me type when i try to type into some programs i just get beeps or nothing happens it is a good idea to include at least openwindows focuslenience true input true in your xdefaults file as these allow non icccm compliant programs to receive input even if they forget to ask for it see the next item for editing xdefaults subject trouble shooting cut and paste not working i can t paste from xterm to xview including sun deskset programs under openwindows two you need to add the following either to your home xdefaults file or to openwinhome lib app defaults xterm instead xterm vt one zero zero translations override l six select set clipboard n l eight insert selection clipboard you must not move the mouse between ending the selection and pressing l eight the paste key under openwindows three this is already in the app defaults file so if it isn t working check that xfilesearchpath is set to usr openwin lib t n s and if it isn t either set it or copy merge the above lines from openwinhome lib app defaults xterm into usr lib x one one app defaults xterm see also environment variables this version automatically puts each xterm selection onto the clipboard xterm vt one zero zero translations override n ctrl meta insert selection primary cut buffer zero n ctrl meta select end primary cut buffer zero clipboard n l eight insert selection clipboard note be sure that the n is at the very end of the line there must be no following spaces and any or signs showing that this faq file was altered must also be removed if you are using x one one r five you may find that adding the lines l one zero start extend select end primary clipboard cut buffer zero n l one zero kill selection n before the l eight line will make l one zero cut work as a cut key if you alter home xdefaults instead you must use what x calls a more specific resource name xterm vt one zero zero translations will do i can t paste from xview including sun deskset programs to xterm if you don t have the sun l keys on the left of your keyboard you can use meta x meta c and meta v for cut coy and paste respectively you can change the keys by adding the following two lines to your xdefaults file edited as you wish the values shown here are the defaults openwindows keyboardcommand copy c meta l six openwindows keyboardcommand paste v meta l eight lists of resources are in the manual page for xview and also in the thinnish blue book companion to volume seven xview reference manual from o reilly and also in the olwm and olvwm manual pages i always get the same piece of text when i press paste l eight meta v remove the file tmp textsw shelf and see if that helps see also the next item cut copy and paste don t work at all openwindows only oh dear use ps xuaww grep xv to check that sv xv sel svc is running and that either you or root started it depending on whether you started openwindows with openwin or by logging in through xdm if not start it if it dies check that there is no tmp sv xv sel svc before restarting it you may need to be root to remove it or you can reboot your workstation check that there is space in tmp use df tmp and also see if there are a lot of files there with names like tmp tty txt a zero one two four six if there are several hundred of them cut and paste may take so long that it times out quit any deskset tools such as mailtool filemgr and cm calendar start a terminal emulator and remove and tmp tty txt and tmp text files that are still there it s simplest to quit openwin and start it again after doing that if cut and paste was broken but if it starts working again you can just carry on note that files in tmp not owned by you might be in use by another worker comrade so don t remove those without checking first subject trouble shooting not authorized to use display if you get error messages that look like xlib connection to zero zero refused by server xlib internal error during connection authorization check error can t open display try on the machine running openwindows or x one one xhost machine where machine is the computer on which you ran the command that failed if you want to let other users run programs on the same machine as you using your display you will have to type the bizarre looking xhost hostname or xhost happyboy if happyboy is the name of your workstation this lets any user on happyboy access your display with openwindows three zero you can also use xauth and the programmer s guide describes how to do this in chapter eight p one zero one this is more secure also check the man page for fbtab five to stop other users accessing the framebuffer directly also note that there is a sun patch for openwindows three zero under sunos four one one to fix a serious security problem it is available through your local sun answer center as well as through anonymous ftp from ftp uu net one nine two four eight nine six two system in sun dist fix patchid filename checksum loadmodule one zero seven six one one eight one zero zero four four eight zero one tar z zero four three five four five on an x terminal there may be a setup menu that lets you change or disable the list of hosts that can access the display if you start getting this message after you ve been logged in overnight there might be a cron job that s removing the unix sockets in tmp that are used to communicate with the server when display doesn t have a hostname before the or is empty have the system administrator change the cron script to skip sockets subject trouble shooting other common problems i get console error messages on my screen and they don t go away sun three or four if refresh makes the messages vanish but new ones come along later you need to run xterm c from your xinitrc or start one up in the background and then choose save workspace from the workspace utilities menu better still pick up contool and run that get it from export lcs mit edu in the contrib directory it will monitor the console and open flash its icon or beep when a message appears it s very easy to configure if refresh from the workspace utilities menu doesn t make the messages go away a sun with a cg four frame buffer has two screens you can move the mouse off the right hand by default edge of the screen and onto a whole new but monochrome display called zero one see the man page for openwin i have a shell script that checks for this and if there s a dev cgfour zero does openwin dev dev cgfour zero dev dev bwtwo zero if you are running x one one or openwindows two you might need to add this to your xinitrc or other startup file eval svenv display unix zero one env olvwm display unix zero one the new one is fantastic when i leave openwindows my screen goes blank or my mouse cursor stays on the screen try running clear colormap if this helps put it as the last line in the shell script you use to start openwindows e g openwin when i use snapshot the system crashes or the server hangs or something this was a bug related to some systems only the only work round was to use some other screen dump program such as xwd xv two two one or xgrabsc why have some of my function keys stopped working keys f one one and f one two changed from sunf three six and sunf three seven to sunxk f three six and sunxk f three seven respectively in openwindows three applications must be recompiled or you might be able to use xmodmap or the public domain xkeycaps program to change your keyboard layout back again when i type shelltool or cmdtool or textedit i get the sunview version see under trouble shooting strange error messages below see also next item mixing x one one and openwindows see also next item note that openwindows three zero includes the x one one r four core distribution to patch level one eight but not the contrib directory these notes apply to openwindows two zero although you could also the do same sort of thing with openwindows three zero and x one one r five install the x one one libraries in usr lib x one one you can intermix openwindows and x one one r four or x one one r five they re all compatible in this respect put the x one one binaries in for example usr bin x one one put usr bin x one one last in your path so that you get openwindows versions of programs instead of x one one ones where appropriate although this is a matter of preference in any event put the openwindows bin directory first see the preceding item for more details on that if you have bin or usr bin they re the same directory on sunos earlier in your path than openwinhome bin xview you ll get sunview programs instead of openwindows ones set ld library path so that usr openwin lib is last after the x one one library directory this doesn t matter with openwindows three zero but with older versions you ll get error messages from x one one programs if you don t do this the messages are generally harmless see next item although xdm core dumps if this isn t right set openwinhome to the directory containing openwindows if it isn t usr openwin see also environment variables especially xfilesearchpath i get error messages on my screen about ld so libx one one so four not found set ld library path to be usr openwin if you also use x one one use usr lib usr five lib usr openwin lib if you put this in a shell script or your profile use lib instead of usr openwin this is for bin sh for csh it is different i launch my filemgr and i get ld so map heap error nine at dev zero your system needs to be patched look in openwinhome lib ospatches and install the patch why doesn t answerbook run for me you must be running openwindows to use answerbook it won t run under x one one on an x terminal or on anything else because it uses news to draw the postscript text and pictures if you are using openwindows three zero you need to use the openwindows three zero compatible navigator it s called navigator ow three on the answerbook cd rom if all answerbook users are using openwindows three zero you can replace navigator wih navigator ow three altogether rename the old one first to satisfy your sense of paranoia the navigator ow three binary is also on cd ware vol two note that the data files are in postscript so you can look at them with a postsript viewer q v why aren t there any fish in realxfishdb a fixed version of realxfishdb is available by ftp from ftp eng auburn edu one three one two zero four one zero nine one as pub realxfishdb z why is the properties choice disabled in the window menu it isn t implemented yet many programs do respond to the properties key l three though or have a pop up menu with properties on it file completion in the c shell is broken in cmdtool sadly true but use shelltool or xterm instead and it s fine it also works if you run command tool on a remote machine fixed in openwindows three zero one shipped with solaris two when i run olit programs some of the widgets are red release three of olit added mouseless operation action widgets can be selected via the keyboard the currently selected item is highlighted in red the red stain to show that it has the input focus to disable it in most places add this to your home xdefaults file traversalon off textedit traversalon on textfield traversalon on you can change the color using for example inputfocuscolor grey five zero input focuscolor green list inputfocuscolor see the man page resources three w at the start of the olit three widget set reference manual included in the openwindows three programmer documentation meanwhile contact your distributor and ask for patch id one zero zero four five one three zero the olit three zero cte jumbo patch when i run several programs the colors on the screen all change when i move into a different window colormap flashing this is becasue most hardware can only display a few colors at a time however you can minimise the effect with the following procedure start all the applications with colors that you wish to reserve run cmap compact save to create the owcolors file put the line cmap compact init near the start of your start up file xinitrc exit and then restart the window system cmap compact init will push those colors owcolors to the end of the colormap and reserves them also note that control l two locks the colors of the current window and control l four unlocks them this is described in the olwm manual page pageiew uses the wrong colors or makes the colormap flash see above this problem was reported by people for some reason running the motif window manager mwm with openwindows try running pageview like this openwinhome bin reservecolors svmono openwinhome bin pageview openwinhome bin reservecolors discard xdm breaks things command tool doesn t like being run without a unix controlling terminal use etc setsid to start your command tools and all will be well sunview applications may need to be run with svenv as in svenv exec usr bin traffic because xdm won t set the necessary environment variables note that the mit xdm starts up the x server as root which is a security hole for openwindows use the openwindows three zero xdm or be aware that your users can access files and start unix processes ass root function keys one one and one two stopped working in openwindows three zero the x one one names keysyms for these keys was changed to sunxk f three six and sunxk f three seven code which uses them should be recompiled or you might be able to get away with xmodmap e keysym sunxk f three six sunf three six subject trouble shooting xview problems this section is here only until an xview faq appears which has been promised but hasn t reached here note that there is also a usenet newsgroup alt toolkits xview although it doesn t sem to have very wide distribution and has triffic of the order of one or two articles per month you should also look at the faq in comp windows x how do i set the font of individual scrolling list items panel list font takes an int row number and an xv opaque font handle panel list fonts take a null terminated list of xv opaque font handles there is no easy way to make an entire list fixed width font you have to make sure that you always specify panel list font when you insert a new row into that list or write a convenience function insert row list row string that hides the nasty bits how do i keep an xview pop up window displayed after a button is pressed in the button callback do xv set button panel notify status xv error null this will keep the window visible you might also need to investigate the menu notify status attribute how do i make an xview button look pressed call panel begin preview and panel cancel preview these are documented in er the xview three source openwindows three imake doesn t work properly here is greg earle s patch to be applied in openwinhome note that you should edit lib config sun cf afterwards to get osname and
