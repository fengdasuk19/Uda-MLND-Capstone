 from bnoble cs cmu edu brian noble subject x server scanline padding question nntp posting host bach coda cs cmu edu organization school of computer science carnegie mellon lines four two i am almost done porting xfree eight six one two to a new piece of display hardware but have run into a snag i think may be somewhat commonplace so i m sending a net feeler i have a display that is a non interlaced memory mapped one bit seven two zero x two eight zero display the server s view of the world obtained via xwd xwud seems to be exactly what it should be however the displayed version of the framebuffer gives the impression that the server is using scanlines that are too long after a bit of experimentation it seems that the problem was that the server was padding the line out to a word boundry but the scanline size in the buffer is nine zero bytes which isn t exactly divisible by four changing the following defines in mit server include servermd h define bitmap scanline pad three two define log two bitmap pad five define log two bytes per scanline pad two to define bitmap scanline pad one six define log two bitmap pad four define log two bytes per scanline pad two was not exactly the right solution how do i tell the server either a don t pad the scan lines at all cause this server is only being built to run on this particular display or to pad only to byte boundries i m using a customized version of xfree eight six v one two under mach three zero thanks brian
