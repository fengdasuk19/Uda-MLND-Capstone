 from smarks trantor eng sun com stuart marks subject re xt intrinsics slow popups organization sun microsystems inc lines three seven distribution world reply to smarks eng sun com nntp posting host trantor in article bryan alex com bryan boreham writes the shell is waiting for the window manager to respond to its positioning request the window manager is not responding because it thinks the window is already in the right place exactly why the two components get into this sulk is unclear to me all information greatly received this problem is caused by a bad interaction between the way olwm reparents windows a misfeature of the x protocol and a bug in the xt intrinsics the intrinsics bug is that it ignores the x y position given in reparentnotify events olwm is structured in such a way that when a window is popped down the last event the client receives is a reparentnotify event at this point the intrinsics notion of the shell s location is out of date if a setvalues is done using the same x y position the intrinsics thinks it needs to move the shell so it issues a configurewindow request to move it there however a mis feature of the x protocol is that a configurewindow request that has no effect will generate no configurenotify event the intrinsics thus waits for an event that will never arrive and times out after wmtimeout has expired actually things are somewhat more complex because the request is redirected to the window manager but the net result is the same the solution is for the intrinsics to note the x y positioning information in reparentnotify events this has been implemented and is available in x one one r five public fix two zero this is xbug five five one three for those of you who are interested in gorier details s marks stuart w marks stuart marks eng sun com window systems technology two five five zero garcia ave m s two one two two eight sunsoft inc mountain view ca nine four zero four three
