 from sriram tcs com sriram srinivasah subject re animation with xputimage organization teknekron communications inc lines two eight in article dcr mail ast cam ac uk derek c richardson writes hi i m new to this group so please bear with me two years ago i wrote a sunview application for fast animation of raster files with sunview becoming rapidly obselete i ve finally decided to rewrite everything from scratch in xview i put together a quick test and i ve found that xputimage is considerably slower factor of two on average than the sunview command pw rop which moves image data from memory pixrects to a canvas this was on a sparc ipx it seems that one the x protocol communication is slowing things down or two xputimage is inefficient or both my question is what is the fastest way in x one one r five to dump eight plane image data to a window can i take advantage of the fact that the client is running on the same machine as the server or am i stuck with xputimage in which case i might as well give up now all help appreciated thanks derek the fastest way is to use an x server with shared memory extension it uses shared memory if it is a local x server hence images don t have to be duplicated and defaults to the regular image routines if either the shared mem extension is not available or if it s not the localhost sriram
