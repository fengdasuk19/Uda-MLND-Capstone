 from sherman lea csc ncsu edu chris sherman subject re xv three zero zero has escaped organization ncsu lines four five in bradley grip cis upenn edu john bradley writes batten down the hatches hide the women and lock up the cows xv three zero zero has finally escaped it really bums me out that xv went shareware xv is shareware for personal use only you may use xv for your own what does this mean anyway can i sit in a company and look at pictures off the net in my spare time amusement and if you find it nifty useful generally cool or of some value to you your non deductable donation would be greatly appreciated two five is the suggested donation though of course larger donations are quite welcome folks who donate two five or more can receive a real nice bound copy of the xv manual for no extra charge commercial government and institutional users must register their copies of xv for the exceedingly reasonable price of just two five per workstation x terminal site licenses are available for those who wish to run xv on a large number of machines contact the author for more details now since universities are institutions right doesn t this mean that most everyone in the world is affected by this i don t believe there are that many running x windows at home yet relatively speaking can the author legally sell xv xv uses tiff and jpeg code developed by others did the author get permission to sell these works did the author also get permission from all the people who contributed to xv to sell their work as well my guess is that now nobody is going to want to help the author maintain the code anymore now that xv has become a commercial product and support for xv will begin to slide downhill if this is the case then that s a bummer i really liked xv chris sherman sherman lea csc ncsu edu
