 from swalker bbn com susan walker subject xmtextfield truncation with lang bug organization bolt beranek and newman bbn lines four two distribution world nntp posting host spcsun one eight bbn com i have found a situation which i think is a bug in x or motif but i m hoping is really just a mistake on my part does anyone know anything about this problem i am using an xmtextfield and setting its xmnvalue to a hardcoded text string ascii or kanji either via xtsetvalues or xmtextsetstring the problem is that when the xmtextfield is displayed the text is getting truncated depending on the setting of the environment variables lang more specifically lc all when they are set to japanese the text gets truncated when they are set to english everything works fine i am taking the default for xmncolumns please note that hardcoding of text is not done in my actual application just in my sample code to make things easier i am running motif one two x one one r five via hpux nine zero one my test program is set up to handle one six bit kanji characters i have remembered to do xtsetlanguageproc prior to my mrminitialize and my font resources are set to japanese fonts don t know if this matters but my dialog box and textfield is initially created with uil the problem does not happen with xmtext unfortunately substituting xmtextfields with xmtexts in my application is not an acceptable alternative way too much code to be modified while in beta i have a small test program which illustrates the problem if anyone wants it my best guess is that either the x code or motif is not properly allocating memory for japanese but since i don t have the source to look at it is just a guess please let me know if this sounds familiar or if you have a suggestion or if you want the sample program thanks susan swalker bbn com six one seven eight seven three eight one nine zero
