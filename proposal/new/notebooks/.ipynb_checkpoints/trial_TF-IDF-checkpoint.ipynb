    "1. 使用修改过的 `wikifil.pl`（称为 `newfil.pl`） 对每个文件进行预处理\n",
    "    + 修改方式：注释掉 13-15 行的语句，在 16 行加入一个 `{` 即可\n",
    "2. 读入经过 1. 预处理的文本数据，保存到 `data['nearRaw.train']` 和 `data['nearRaw.test']` 中\n",
    "    + 每条数据的**文本内容**保存到 `data['nearRaw.train']['content']` 或 `data['nearRaw.test']['content']` 中（取决于这条数据是训练数据还是测试数据）\n",
    "    + 每条数据的**正确分类**保存到 `data['nearRaw.train']['class']` 或 `data['nearRaw.test']['class']` 中（取决于这条数据是训练数据还是测试数据）\n",
    "3. [向量化 + TF-IDF] + 转换 + 存储\n",
    "    1. 使用 `sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer` 完成：词袋计数向量化 + TF-IDF 权重计算\n",
    "        + 使用 [`sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.fit`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.fit) 完成词汇学习与计算过程\n",
    "    2. 使用 [`sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.transform`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.transform) 将`data['nearRaw.train']`中的 `stringContent` 和 `data['nearRaw.test']`中的 `stringContent` 进行处理，将结果输出到 `data['matrix.train']` 与 `data['matrix.test']` 中，供后续学习和训练使用\n",
    "    3. 将 `data['matrix.train']` 与 `data['matrix.test']` 转换成 `Pandas.DataFrame` 格式，保存到 `df['train']` 和 `df['test']` 中（`df` 为字典格式：`String -> DataFrame`）\n",
    "4. 使用 `df['train']` 为数据集，任选一种学习方法，训练出分类器 `clf`\n",
    "5. 使用分类器 `clf` 对 `df['test']` 进行实际分类后，评估 `clf` 的效果\n"
