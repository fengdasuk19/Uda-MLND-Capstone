theism is strongly correlated with irrational belief in absolutes irrational belief in absolutes is strongly correlated with fanatism deletion theism is correlated with fanaticism i have neither said that all fanatism is caused by theism nor that all theism leads to fanatism the point is theism increases the chance of becoming a fanatic one could of course argue that would be fanatics tend towards theism for example but i just have to loook at the times in history when theism was the dominant ideology to invalidate that conclusion that that is the basic mechanism behind it imo the influence of stalin or for that matter ayn rand invalidates your assumption that theism is the factor to be considered bogus i just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism the point is that theism is a factor that s your claim now back it up i consider your argument as useful as the following belief is strongly correlated with fanaticism therefore belief is a factor in fanaticism true and utterly useless note this is any belief not belief in gods gullibility blind obedience to authority lack of scepticism and so on are all more reliable indicators and the really dangerous people the sources of fanaticism are often none of these things they are cynical manipulators of the gullible who know precisely what they are doing that s a claim you have to support please note that especially in the field of theism the leaders believe what they say if you believe that you re incredibly naive now some brands of theism and more precisely some theists do tend to fanaticism i grant you to tar all theists with this brush is bigotry not a reasoned argument and it reads to me like a warm up for censorship and restriction of religious freedom ever read animal farm that s a straw man and as usually in discussions with you one has to repeat it read what i have written above not every theism leads to fanatism and not all fanatism is caused by theism the point is there is a correlation and it comes from innate features of theism no some of it comes from features which some theism has in common with some fanaticism your last statement simply isn t implied by what you say before because you re trying to sneak in innate features of all theism the word you re groping for is some gullibility by the way is one of them no shit sherlock so why not talk about gullibility instead of theism since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have as opposed to the case you are trying to make and to say that i am going to forbid religion is another of your straw men interesting that you have nothing better to offer i said it reads like a warm up to that that s because it s an irrational and bogus tirade and has no other use than creating a nice them us split in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either side of church walls two define irrational belief e g is it rational to believe that reason is always useful irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason the latter has been discussed for a long time with charley wingate one point is that the beliefs violate reason often and another that a process that does not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable information well there is a glaring paradox here an argument that reason is useful based on reason would be circular and argument not based on reason would be irrational which is it that s bogus self reference is not circular and since the evaluation of usefulness is possible within rational systems it is allowed o k it s oval it s still begging the question however and though that certainly is allowed it s not rational and you claiming to be rational and all at the risk of repeating myself and hearing we had that before we didn t hear a refutation before so we re back deal with it you can t use reason to demonstrate that reason is useful someone who thinks reason is crap won t buy it you see your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics and mathematics are therfore circular anybody else think godel was silly the first part of the second statement contains no information because you don t say what the beliefs are if the beliefs are strong theism and or strong atheism then your statement is not in general true the second part of your sentence is patently false counterexample an axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis but is assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is used to obtain it i ve been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions of god here an axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis what you say here is a an often refuted fallacy have a look at the discussion of the axiom of choice and further one can evaluate axioms in larger systems out of which they are usually derived i exist is derived if you want it that way further one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms what is it you are trying to say that at some point people always wind up saying this datum is reliable for no particular reason at all example i am not dreaming compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational i can t agree with this until you are specific which theism to say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which i suspect you do not have using the traditonal definition of gods personal supernatural entities with objective effects on this world usually connected to morals and or the way the world works imo any belief about such gods is necessarily irrational that does not mean that people who hold them are in principle opposed to the exercise of intelligence some atheists are also scientists for example the affinity to fanatism is easily seen it has to be true because i believe it is nothing more than a work hypothesis however the beliefs say they are more than a work hypothesis i don t understand this can you formalise your argument person a believes system b becuase it sounds so nice that does not make b true it is at best a work hypothesis however the content of b is that it is true and that it is more than a work hypothesis testing or evaluating evidence for or against it therefore dismissed because b already believed says it is wrong a waste of time not possible depending on the further contents of b amalekites idolaters protestants are to be killed this can have interesting effects peculiar definition of interesting but sure now show that a belief in gods entails the further contents of which you speak why aren t my catholic neighbours out killing the protestants for example maybe they don t believe in it maybe it s the conjunction of b asserts b and jail kill dissenters that is important and the belief in gods is entirely irrelevant it certainly seems so to me but then i have no axe to grind here frank o dwyer i m not hatching that odwyer sse ie from hens by evelyn

na lines one four two andrew newell tan one zero two psuvm psu edu wrote i think you re letting atheist mythology confuse you on the issue of webster myth a traditional or legendary story a belief whose truth is accepted uncritically how does that qualify indeed it s almost oxymoronic a rather amusing instance i ve found that most atheists hold almost no atheist views as accepted uncritically especially the few that are legend many are trying to explain basic truths as myths do but they don t meet the other criterions andrew the myth to which i refer is the convoluted counterfeit athiests have created to make religion appear absurd rather than approach religion including christainity in a rational manner and debating its claims as the are stated atheists concoct outrageous parodies and then hold the religious accountable for beliefs they don t have what is more accurately oxymoric is the a term like reasonable atheist bill divine justice according to the most fundamental doctrines of christianity when the first man sinned he was at that time the you accuse him of referencing mythology then you procede to launch your own xtian mythology this time meeting all the requirements of myth here s a good example of of what i said above read the post again i said acoording to which means i am referring to christian doctrine as i understand it if i am speaking for myself you ll know it my purpose in posting was to present a basic overview of christain doctrines since it seemed germane bill with those who pretend not to know what is being said and what it means when atheists claim that they do not know if god exists and don t know what he wants they contradict the bible which clearly says that everyone knows the authority of the bible is its claim to be should i repeat what i wrote above for the sake of getting it across you may trust the bible but your trusting it doesn t make it any more credible to me if the bible says that everyone knows that s clearly reason to doubt the bible because not everyone knows your alleged god s alleged existance again i am paraphrasing christian doctrine which is very clear on this point your dispute is not with me bill refuted while the species wide condemnation is justified those that claim that there is no evidence for the existence of god or that his will is unknown must deliberately ignore the bible the ignorance itself is no excuse one no they don t have to ignore the bible the bible is far from universally accepted the bible is not a proof of god it is only a proof that some people have thought that there was a god or does it prove even that they might have been writing it as series of fiction short stories as in the case of dionetics assuming the writers believed it the only thing it could possibly prove is that they believed it and that s ignoring the problem of whether or not all the interpretations and biblical philosophers were correct two there are people who have truly never heard of the bible three again read the faq one here again you miss the point the bible itself is not the point it s what it contains it makes no difference who accpets the bible or even who s unaware of its existence christians hold that it applies universally because mankind shares the same nature and the same fate and the same innate knowledge of god two see above three if you read my post with same care as read the faq we wouldn t be having this conversation bill freedom you are free to ignore god in the same way you are free to ignore gravity and the consequences are inevitable and well known in both cases that an atheist can t accept the evidence means only bzzt wrong answer gravity is directly there it doesn t stop exerting a direct and rationally undeniable influence if you ignore it god on the other hand doesn t generally show up in the supermarket except on the tabloids god doesn t exert a rationally undeniable influence gravity is obvious gods aren t as i said the evidence is there you just don t accept it here at least we agree bill secondly human reason is very comforatble with the concept of god so much so that it is in itself intrinsic to our nature human reason always comes back to the question of god in every generation and in no human reason hasn t always come back to the existance of god it has usually come back to the existance of god in other words it doesn t generally come back to the xtian god it comes back to whether there is any god and in much of oriental philosophic history it generally doesn t pop up as the idea of a god so much as the question of what natural forces are and which ones are out there from a world wide view human nature just makes us wonder how the universe came to be and or what force s are currently in control a natural tendancy to believe in god only exists in religious wishful thinking yes human reason does always come back to the existence of god we re having this discussion are we not bill i said all this to make the point that christianity is eminently reasonable that divine justice is just and human nature is much different than what atheists think it is whether you agree or not you certainly are not correct on human nature you are at the least basing your views on a completely eurocentric approach try looking at the outside world as well when you attempt to sum up all of humanity well this is interesting truth is to be determined by it politically correct content granted it s extremely unhip to be a wasp male and anything european is contemptable but i thought this kind of dialogue the purpose of a a was to get at the truth of things but then i remember the oxymoron reasonalble atheist and i understand bill

hast denied me thrice joh one eight two seven peter then denied again and immediately the cock crew destruction of cities what said was jeremiah was zechariah this is interesting because matthew quotes a prophesy that was never made not the only time he does this either mat two seven nine then was fulfilled that which was spoken by jeremy the prophet saying and they took the thirty pieces of silver the price of him that was valued whom they of the children of israel did value zechariah one one one one one three nothing in jeremiah remotely like what was the color of the robe placed on jesus during his trial scarlet matthew two seven two eight purple john one nine two the time of the crucifiction mark says the third hour or nine a m but john says the sixth hour noon was when the sentence was passed inscription on the cross matthew this is jesus the king of the jews mark the king of the jews luke this is the king of the jews john jesus of nazareth the king of the jews what did they give him to drink vinegar matthew two seven three four wine with myrrh mark one five two three women at the cross matthew said many stood far off including mary magdaline mary the mother of james and the mother of zebedee s children mark and luke speak of many far off and mark includes mary magdeline and mary the mother of james the less john says that jesus s mother stood at the cross along with her sister and mary magdalene jesus last words matt two seven four six five zero and about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice saying eli eli lama sabachthani that is to say my god my god why hast thou forsaken me jesus when he cried again with a loud voice yielded u the ghost luke two three four six and when jesus had cried with a loud voice he said father unto thy hands i commend my spirit and having said thus he gave up the ghost john one nine three zero when jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost events of the crucifiction matthew says that the veil of the temple was rent that there was an earthquake and that it was dark from the sixth to the ninth hour that graves opened and bodies of the saints arose and went into jeruselem appearing to many beating jesus to the resurection mark and luke speak of darkness and the veil of the temple being rent but mention no earthquake or risen saints john is the only one who mentions jesus s side being peirced burial of jesus matthew says the jews asked pilate for a guard to prevent the body from being stolen by the disciples and for the tomb to be sealed all of this was supposedly done but the other gospels do not mention these precautions how long was jesus in the tomb depends where you look matthew one two four zero gives jesus prophesying that he will spend three days and three nights in the heart of the earth and mark one zero three four has after three days meta treis emeras he will rise again as far as i can see from a quick look the prophecies have after three days but the post resurrection narratives have on the third day time of the resurection matthew says sunday at dawn mark says the sun was rising and john says it was dark who was at the empty tomb is it mat two eight one in the end of the sabbath as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week came mary magdalene and the other mary to see the sepulchre mar one six one and when the sabbath was past mary magdalene and mary the mother of james and salome had bought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him joh two zero one the first day of the week cometh mary magdalene early when it was yet dark unto the sepulchre and seeth the stone taken away from the sepulchre whom did they see at the tomb mat two eight two and behold there was a great earthquake for the angel of the lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone from the door and sat upon it mat two eight three his countenance was like lightning and his raiment white as snow mat two eight four and for fear of him the keepers did shake and became as dead men mat two eight five and the angel answered and said unto the women fear not ye for i know that ye seek jesus which was crucified mar one six five and entering into the sepulchre they saw a young man sitting on the right side clothed in a long white garment and they were affrighted luk two four four and it came to pass as they were much perplexed thereabout behold two men stood by them in shining garments joh two zero one two and seeth two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of jesus had lain belief that the disciples stole jesus s body matthew says the guard was paid to tell this story but no other gospel makes this claim appearences of the risen jesus matthew says an angel at the tomb told the two marys and that jesus also told them to tell the disciples to meet him in galilee the disciples then went to a mountain previously agreed opon and met jesus there this was his only appearance except to the women at the tomb matthew only devotes five verses to the visit with the disciples mark says that jesus walked with two of the disciples in the country and that they told the rest of the disciples who refused to believe later he appeared to the one one disciples at mealtime luke says two followers went the same day that jesus rose from the dead to emmaus a village eight miles from jeruselem and there jesus jioned them but was unrecognised while they ate a meal together that evening they finally recognised jesus whereopon he dissapeared returning at once to jeruselem they told the disciples of their experience and suddenly jesus appeared among them frightening them as they thought he was a spirit jesus then ate some fish and honey and then preached to them john says jesus appeared to the disciples the evening of the day he arrose in jeruselem where they were hiding he breathed the holy ghost opon them but thomas was not present and refused to believe eight days later jesus joined the disciples again at the same place and this time he convinced thomas once more jesus made an appearance to the disciples at the sea of tiberias but again was not recognised after telling them to cast their netson the other side of the boat jesus becomes known to them and prepares bread and fish for them they all eat together and converse the book of acts further adds to the confusion it says that jesus showed himself to the apostles for a period of four zero days after his resurection thus contradicting matthew mark luke and john and spoke to them of things pertaining to the kingdom of god and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud recieved him out of their sight and while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up two men stood by them in white apparel which also said ye men of galilee why stand ye gazing into heaven this same jesus which is taken from you into heaven shall so comein like manneras ye have seen him go into heaven acts one three one one paul outdoes every other authority by saying that jesus was seen by five zero zero persons between the time of the resurection and the assension although he does not say where he also claims that he himself as one born out of due time also saw jesus one cor one five six eight the ascension matthew says nothing about it mark casually says that jesus was recieved into heaven after he was finished talking with the disciples in jeruselem luke says jesus led the desciples to bethany and that while he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven john says nothing about it acts contradicts all of the above see previous section when second coming mat two four three four verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled mar one three three zero verily i say unto you that this generation shall not pass till all these things be done luk two one three two verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass away till all be fulfilled one thessalonians four one five one eight how many apostles were in office between the resurection and ascention one corinthians one five five one two matthew two seven three five minus one from one two acts one nine two six mathias not elected until after resurrection mat two eight one six then the eleven disciples went away into galilee into a mountain where jesus had appointed them ascend to heaven and elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven two kings two one one no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that came down from heaven the son of man john three one three as you can see there are a number of contradictions in the account of the trial crucifiction and resurection of jesus if these are good witnesses you would think that they could get some of these important details right in fact i cannot find very many points on where they agree you would think that they could at least agree on some of the points they were supposedly observing because of the fact that there is so much contradiction and error the story of the resurection as presented cannot be taken as literal truth due to the nature of the story i doubt if it should be taken as any sort of truth alan

five eight uucp writes deletia in case anybody hadn t noticed frank and i are debating objective morality and seemingly hitting semantics secondly how can i refute your definition i can only point up its logical implications and say that they seem to contradict the usage of the word objective in other areas indeed by your definition an objective x is an oxymoron for all x i have no quibble with that belief other than that it is useless and that objective is a perfectly good word it may be that being a non native english speaker i ve misunderstood your usage of objective and tried to debate something you don t assert my apologies i m at a loss to imagine what you really do mean though how many ages can the universe have and still be internally self consistent i d be amazed if it was more than one how many different moral systems can different members of society have indeed single individuals in some cases and humanity still stick together begging the question people can have many opinions about the age of the universe and humanity can still stick together you are saying that the universe has a real age independent of my beliefs about it why wrong point the age of the universe has no direct effect on humanity s sticking power in the way the moral system of a society can have i m saying the universe has a real age because i see evidence for it cosmology astronomy and so on i say this age is independent of people s opinions of it because i know different people have a lot of different opinions in the matter yet empirical tests consistently seem to give roughly the same results the age of the universe like most scientific facts can be emirically verified through means that ll give the same result no matter who performs the testing albeit there are error bars that may be on the largish side this assumes that the universe has a real age or any kind of reality which doesn t depend on what we think i can t see how it does that put a creationist to the task of performing the tests and calculations see to it s he makes no blatant errors in measuring or calculating and the result of the test will be the same why should an extreme biblical creationist give a rat s ass about the means of which you speak because logically consistent empirical tests contradict their opinion if those tests were just my opinion then their own tests which would then be their opinion would contradict mine even if we conducted said tests in identical manner no they don t which i take as showing these tests have some validity beyond our opinion of them i ve heard of no way to verify morality in a consistent way much less compute the errors of the measurement care to enlighten me the same is true of pain but painkillers exist and can be predicted to work with some accuracy better than a random guess map the activity of nerves and neural activity if you mean physical pain you have a sharp point i ll give you that but you still haven t given me a way to quantify morality i wrote elsewhere that morality should be hypotheses about observed value we agree hypotheses however can change i hold that there is no ultimate hypothesis of morality towards which these changes could gravitate but that they could be changed in any way imaginable producing different results suitable for different tasks or purposes if a moral system makes a prediction it will be better if that can be tested better and worse are almost always defined in the context of a moral system your prediction will always be correct within that moral system what you need now is an objective definition of good and bad i wish you luck people s ideas about the age of object x are not objective you can have any idea you like and i can t stop you universae and their ages is another ballgame they are what they are and if you dislike some detail of them that s a problem with your opinion of them sure assume an objective reality and you get statements like this isn t that what you re doing when assuming an objectively real morality besides what exactly is provably wrong with my statement i claim that morality is an opinion of ours and as such subjective and individual if i m wrong then some more or less objectively real thing exists which you label objective morality can you back up this positive claim of existence can you back up your positive claim above no that s because it s an assumption i make the same assumption about values on the basis that there is no logical difference between the two and the empirical basis of the two is precisely the same claiming there is no objective morality is suddenly a positive claim besides i think i can lend some credence to my claim ponder different individuals both fully functional as human beings and members of society but yet with wildly different moral codes if morality was objective at least one should be way off base but yet hir incorrect morality seems to function fine how come as for producing these individuals it might be easiest to pick them from different societies say an islamic one and some polynesian matrilineal system for example if such still exist deletia testing for footballs on desks now take a look at morality see anything if so please inform me which way to look and why to look that particular way as opposed to some other get my drift no just look are you claiming never to know what good means one thing is good under some circumstances because we wish to achieve some goal for some reason other times we wish to do something else and that thing is no longer so clearly good at all some things are hard to make good because we d seldom if ever wish to achieve the sort of goal mass murder would lead one into still the aztecs were doing fine until the spaniards wiped them out i almost always know what good means sometimes i even know why i never claim this good is thereby fixed in stone immutable that s a simple matter of proving the track record of the scientific method i think it s great and should be applied to values i may be completely wrong but that s what i conclude as a result of quite an amount of thought yes me too and i ve tried a thing or two down that line it doesn t look good for objective values to me at all disclaimer it s great to be young and insane

caricature is not my favourite point needless to say at length in a previous outing and am currently discussing it with eric rescorla b there s little point in responding the same points everywhere i do my best to give everyone the courtesy of a reply you still repeat that point i do curious since i believe that was the first time i ve ever made it not that repetition would imply much more than your seeming inability to understand you ask me the same question i ll give you the same answer especially when in this case i know the answer to be true i do my best to give everyone the courtesy of a reply but if everyone is making the same points and i m pushed for time then i try to respond what i believe are the strongest formulations of those points if that doesn t include your post tough this is usenet and life is tough all over c since there s a great deal of responses this isn t always feasible i do my best to honestly answer questions put to me you drop out of debates with some posters and continue with others you appear with the same issue every n months and start the dicussion at the beginning again i ve only debated this issue twice in a a and occasionally in t a the first was in response to simon clippingdale s positive assertion that disagreement about moral values inexorably acknowledges that morals are relative it doesn t now simon has dropped out of the debate for some time i take that to mean that he is either busy or bored with the topic i certainly do not accuse him of dishonesty do you d i can t always understand what you say neither can t i understand you all the time usually one asks what the other side means usually one does usually you re clear but sometimes you aren t and i ask you what you mean other times you seem to get extremely uptight and i feel that i m debating against line noise sometimes i get tired and sometimes i have other things i d rather do again this is usenet and life is tough all over you re going to have to deal with it e you re starting to get personally insulting i may not even put your name in the hat in future that s supposed to be a threat no that s a simple statement and an assertion that i am not answerable to those who offer me baseless insults for example those who accuse me of lying about my personal beliefs while also complaining that i don t answer their questions like that you what you sense is evidence for the sensed to be there if only everything would be so easy what almost everyone senses is evidence for the sensed to be there because to all intents and purposes it is there we had that argument for one your claim that everyone senses it is not founded and you have been asked to give evidence for it often and then the correct statement would be it is reason to assume that it is there unless evidence against it has been found i have no problem with the second statement i have provided an argument that almost everyone senses that freedom is valuable the only cogent objection to this came from jon livesey and was offered by some other people too essentially that people disagree about fuzzy concepts such as freedom it s a good point and i m thinking about it your trick is to say i feel a is not right and so do many i know therefore a is absolutely right it neglects the possibility that these people consider a to be right as an effect of the same process restricting the claim of its absoluteness to those who have been subject of that process in other words refutes it you make the ontological claim you have to prove it nonsense my trick is to say i feel that a is better than b and so does almost any disinterested person i ask best evidence is therefore that a really is better than b subject to the assumption that we can establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by a and b and that the resulting system of values is self consistent now get this really is better is an idealisation a fictional model in the same sense that real material existence is a fictional model it may or may not correspond to something true it is nonetheless a useful assumption far more useful than the equally assumed relativist trick to wit i feel that a is better than b and so does almost any disinterested person i ask however if even one person disagrees that a is better than b or if even one person dissents from mutually agreed definitions of a and b then it is the case that b is better than a for that person and nothing more can be said i say this is useless because it inexorably implies that a supermajority seeking to maximise a cannot morally take action against someone seeking to maximise b e g a terrorist to do that would be to claim that a supermajority s carefully considered morality would be better than the terrorist s which would of course be true but a no no for an ethical relativist to claim that ethical relativism implies anything else is simply weasel words and an example of compartmentalisation to rival anything in the world of religion for a similar argument i sense morality is subjective it does not hurt me to do things that are considered to be objectively wrong by others if you mean that you do things that some others consider objectively wrong and it turns out not to be the case for you of course this is possible it is neither evidence for subjectivism nor evidence against objectivism except sometimes in a pragmatic sense it serves as a counterexample for that everything that is subject to judgements is absolute and as long as you don t provide evidence for that there is something universally agreed upon there is no reason to believe your hypothesis i ve done this freedom with the proviso that i still have to answer jon s objection that fuzzy concepts like freedom have no objective meaning further in order to make morality absolute universal or objective you would have to show that it is independent of humans or the attributes above look quite misleading not really what evidence is there that anything exists independently of humans you ll be hard pressed to find any that isn t logically equivalent when applied to values an analogous set of premises would be premise one some people believe that objectively speaking the shortest route from my house to a bar is through the main entrance of the estate and down the malahide road premise two i checked it out and found that the shortest route from my which is much closer you would never deduce from these that there is no shortest route from my house to a bar yet that is seemingly how you derive your relativist claim using premises which are logically no different no morals are a matter of belief so far the people still believe that the shortest way is through the main entrance no agreement on belief here and in order to have an analogy you would have to show that there is a shortest way and that there is a method to convince everyone of that it is the shortest way indeed in other words your analogy works only when one assumes that your premises are right in the first place if not it is a fallacy and if this were an argument for objectivism you d be right it isn t though it s a demonstration that the argument you gave me is neither argument against objectivism nor argument for relativism your gimmick is to assume in the first place that values aren t real and to use this to prove that values aren t real in other words you beg the question against me frank o dwyer i m not hatching that odwyer sse ie from hens by evelyn conlon

if he she did you would probably consider it rape of course not i would think that would be great fun not having ever felt the joy and peace the christians speak of with a longing gaze this is not what i got when i believed i just tried to hide my fear of getting punished for something i never was sure of the bible is hopelessly confusing for someone who wants to know for sure god did not answer in the end i found i had been following a mass delusion a lie i can t believe in a being who refuses to give a slightest hint of her existence obviously there are many christians who have tried and do believe so i suggest they should honestly reconsider the reasons why they believe and analyse their position in fact it is amusing to note in this context that many fundamentalist publications tell us exactly the opposite one should not examine one s belief critically i ll tell you something i left out of my testimony i posted to this group two months ago a day after i finally found out my faith is over i decided to try just one more time the same cycle of emotional responses fired once again but this time the delusion lasted only a couple of hours i told my friend in a phone that it really works thank god just to think about it again when i hung up i had to admit that i had lied and fallen prey to the same illusion no one asks you to swallow everything in fact jesus warns against it but let me ask you a question do you beleive what you learn in history class or for that matter anything in school i mean it s just what other people have told you and you don t want to swallow what others say right i used to believe what i read in books when i was younger or what other people told me but i grew more and more skeptical the more i read i learned what it means to use reason as a student of chemistry i had to perform a qualitative analysis of a mixture of two organic compounds in the lab i hated experiments like this they are old fashioned and increase the student s workload considerably besides i had to do it twice since i failed in my first attempt however i think i ll never forget the lesson no matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown is x it may still be y it is very tempting to jump into conclusions take a leap of faith assure oneself ignore the data which is inconsistent but it can still be wrong i found out that i was after all using exactly the same mechanism to believe in god mental self assurance suspension of fear filtering of information in other words it was only me no god playing any part the life death and resurection of christ is documented historical fact oh and i had better believe this dan many ufo stories are much better documented than the resurrection of jesus the resurrection is documented quite haphazardly in the bible it seems the authors did not pay too much attention to which wild rumour to leave out besides the ends of the gospels probably contain later additions and insertions for instance the end of mark one six nine two zero is missing from many early texts says my bible jesus may have lived and died but he was probably misunderstood as much as anything else you learn how do you choose what to believe and what not to this is easy i believe that the world exists independent of my mind and that logic and reason can be used to interpret and analyse what i observe nothing else need to be taken on faith i will go by the evidence it makes no difference whether i believe george washington existed or not i assume that he did considering the vast amount of evidence presented there is no way to get into a sceptical heart you can not say you have given a sincere effort with the attitude you seem to have you must trust not just go to church and participate in it s activities were you ever willing to die for what you believed a liar how do you know what my attitude was try reading your bible again i was willing to die for my faith those who do are usually remembered as heroes at least among those who believe dan do you think i m lying when i say i believed firmly for one five years it seems it is very difficult to admit that someone who has really believed does not do so anymore

 from mcelwre cnsvax uwec edu subject free energy technology organization university of wisconsin eau claire lines two four eight important info it is humbly suggested by robert s fans that you redirect all followups into alt fan robert mcelwaine or at least consider doing so free energy technology by robert e mcelwaine physicist ninety to a hundred years ago everybody knew that a heavier than air machine could not possibly fly it would violate the laws of physics all of the experts and authorities said so for example simon newcomb declared in one nine zero one the demonstration that no possible combination of known substances known forms of machinery and known forms of force can be united in a practical machine by which man shall fly long distances through the air seems to the writer as complete as it is possible for the demonstration of any physical fact to be fortunately a few smart people such as the wright brothers did not accept such pronouncements as the final word now we take airplanes for granted except when they crash today orthodox physicists and other scientists are saying similar things against several kinds of free energy technologies using negative terms such as pseudo science and perpetual motion and citing so called laws which assert that energy cannot be created or destroyed one st law of thermodynamics and there is always a decrease in useful energy two nd law of thermodynamics the physicists do not know how to do certain things so they arrogantly declare that those things cannot be done such principles of impotence are common in orthodox modern science and help to cover up inconsistencies and contradictions in orthodox modern theories free energy inventions are devices which can tap a seemingly unlimited supply of energy from the universe with out burning any kind of fuel making them the perfect solution to the world wide energy crisis and its associated pollution degradation and depletion of the environment most free energy devices probably do not create energy but rather tap into existing natural energy sources by various forms of induction unlike solar or wind devices they need little or no energy storage capacity because they can tap as much energy as needed when needed solar energy has the dis advantage that the sun is often blocked by clouds trees buildings or the earth itself or is reduced by haze or smog or by thick atmosphere at low altitudes and high latitudes likewise wind speed is widely variable and often non existent neither solar nor wind power are suitable to directly power cars and airplanes properly designed free energy devices do not have such limitations for example at least three u s patents three eight one one zero five eight three eight seven nine six two two and four one five one four three one have so far been awarded for motors that run exclusively on permanent magnets seemingly tapping into energy circulating through the earth s magnetic field the first two require a feedback network in order to be self running the third one as described in detail in science correct seven digit patent number required or try getting copies of both the article and the patents via your local public or university library s inter library loan dept a second type of free energy device such as the gray motor u s patent three eight nine zero five four eight the tesla coil and the motor of inventor joseph newman see science two one zero eight four pages five seven one two taps electro magnetic energy by induction from earth resonance about one two cycles per second plus harmonics they typically have a spark gap in the circuit which serves to synchronize the energy in the coils with the energy being tapped it is important that the total inductance and capacitance of the device combine to resonate at the same frequency as earth resonance in order to maximize the power output this output can also be increased by centering the spark gap at the neutral center of a strong u shaped permanent magnet in the case of a tesla coil slipping a toroid choke coil around the secondary coil will enhance output power earth energy fuelless propulsion and its very high torque makes it ideal for large trucks preventing their slowing down when climbing hills david mcclintock is also the real original inventor of the automatic transmission differential and four wheel drive crystals may someday be used to supply energy as shown in the star trek shows perhaps by inserting each one between metal capacitor plates and bombarding it with a beam of particles from a small radioactive source like that used in a common household smoke detector one other energy source should be mentioned here despite the fact that it does not fit the definition of free energy a bulgarian born american physicist named joseph maglich has invented and partially developed an atomic fusion reactor which he calls migma which uses non radioactive deuterium as a fuel available in nearly unlimited quantities from sea water does not produce radioactive waste can be converted directly into electricity with out energy wasting steam turbines and can be constructed small enough to power a house or large enough to power a city and unlike the tokamaks and laser fusion monstrosities that we read about migma works already producing at least three watts of power for every watt put in new times u s version six two six seven eight pages three two four zero and then there are the cold fusion experiments that have been in the news lately originally conducted by university of utah researchers b stanley pons and martin fleischmann some u s navy researchers at the china lake naval weapons center in california under the direction of chemist melvin miles finally took the trouble to collect the bubbles coming from such an apparatus had them analyzed with mass spectrometry techniques and found helium four which proves that atomic fusion did indeed take place and enough of it to explain the excess heat generated there are good indications that the two so called laws of thermodynamics are not so absolute for example the late physicist dewey b larson developed a comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe which he calls the reciprocal system which he describes in detail in several books such as nothing but motion one nine seven nine and the universe of motion one nine eight four in which the physical universe has two distinct halves the material half and an anti matter half with a continuous cycle of matter and energy passing between them with out the heat death predicted by thermodynamic laws his theory explains the universe much better than modern orthodox theories including phenomena that orthodox physicists and astronomers are still scratching their heads about and is self consistent in every way some free energy devices might be tapping into that energy flow seemingly converting low quality energy into high quality energy also certain religious organizations such as sant mat and eckankar teach their members that the physical universe is only the lowest of at least a dozen major levels of existence like parallel universes or analogous to tv channels as described in books like the path of the masters by dr julian johnson one nine three nine and eckankar the key to secret worlds by sri paul twitchell one nine six nine for example the next level up from the physical universe is commonly called the astral plane long time members of these groups have learned to soul travel into these higher worlds and report on conditions there it seems plausible that energy could flow down from these higher levels into the physical universe or be created at the boundary between them given the right configuration of matter to channel it this is supported by many successful laboratory controlled experiments in psycho kinesis throughout the world such as those described in the book psychic discoveries behind the iron curtain in terms of economics the market has failed inventors do not have enough money and other resources to fully develop and mass produce free energy equipment and the conventional energy producer have no desire to do so because of their ve ted intere t the government is needed to intervene if the government does not intervene then the total supply of energy resources from the earth will continue to decline and will soon run out prices for energy will increase and pollution and its harmful effects including the greenhouse effect acid rain smog radioactive contamination oil spills rape of the land by strip mining etc will continue to increase the government should subsidize research and development of free energy by inventors and universities subsidize private production until the producers can make it on their own and subsidize consumption by low income consumers of free energy hardware the long range effects of such government intervention would be wide spread and profound the quantity of energy demanded from conventional energy producer coal mining companie oil companie and countries electric utilitie etc would drop to near zero forcing their employees to seek work elsewhere energy resources coal uranium oil and gas would be left in the ground prices for conventional energy supplies would also drop to near zero while the price of free energy equipment would start out high but drop as supply increases as happened with vcr s personal computers etc costs of producing products that require large quantities of energy to produce would decrease along with their prices to consumers consumers would be able to realize the opportunity costs of paying electric utility bills or buying home heating fuel tourism would benefit and increase because travelers would not have to spend their money for gasoline for their cars government tax revenue from gasoline and other fuels would have to be obtained in some other way and energy could no longer be used as a motive or excuse for making war many conventional energy producer would go out of business but society as a whole and the earth s environment and ecosystems would benefit greatly it is the people that government

you can and hide them soon after the antichrist becomes the leader of the european community the revived roman empire bibles will be confiscated and owning a bible will be tantamount to treason the bible however will be your most valuable possession during the tribulation iv read the bible like you have never read it before in your life since all of your bibles may be confiscated even if you are careful it is imperative that you read the word until you memorize whole passages and can quote them it is especially important to read daniel luke two one matthew two four revelation and amos for these books describe the events you can expect to unfold before you v pray like you have never prayed before in your life pray until the power of god comes strongly upon you pray and pray and pray only by reading the word and praying will you gain the spiritual strength to be able to withstand the torture you may have to endure for the sake of christ vi do not take the mark at any cost even in fit means you and your loved ones die as martyrs after the antichrist becomes the leader of the european community he will institute a world economic system designed so that you cannot buy sell or eat unless you take his mark or the number of his name money will be useless and he causes all both small and great rich and poor free and slave to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads and that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name here is wisdom let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast for it is

history matt two four two one i saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held and a white robe was given to each of them and it

for the word of god who had not worshiped the beast or his image and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on the hands revelation two zero four he will use every form of torture and humiliation in order to force you to renounce christ nor will he hesitate to use your loved ones against you even your children torturing and killing them in front of you so that you will be tempted to take the mark if you take the mark or worship the antichrist or his image however you will be consigned to the second death which is the lake of fire sung about so eloquently by johnny cash m you cannot be redeemed it is better to endure torture for a short while and gain eternal life then sic to endure eternal torment in the ring h h h h lake of fire if anyone worships the beast and his image and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand he himself shall also drink the wine of the wrath of god which is poured out full strength into the cup of his indignation an sic he shall be

tribulation all of the time you gain in hiding is important for your spiritual growth and strengthening since only those who are extremely strong in christ can suffer and die for his sake the first thing to do is move out of the city and into a rural or mountainous area for the antichrist s control will come last to the least populated areas take a good radio or tv with you so that you can stay attuned to events and discern the time schedule of the tribulation as you can see on the weather map heavy currents of tribulation will sweep into our area by daybreak expect delays on i nine five outbound and perhaps school closings m store water and food because you will not be able to purchase anything without the mark water in lakes and streams will be polluted by radioactive waste from nuclear warfare and will eventually turn into blood get a good water filter m bring different types of clothing for all seasons as well as flashlights batteries generators and first aid supplies in short learn how to survive and live off the land as the pioneers did viii trust no one there will be secret agents everywhere spying for the antichrist s government be on the lookout perot supporters take note m ix watch for the antichrist it is important to realize who the antichrist is and what he is up to for he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will bring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it we can infer from daniel one one certain characteristics of this man popular during the first three and a half years of the tribulation he will dominate the airwaves he will be physically appealing highly intelligent with christ like charisma and personality an international politician military tactician and economic expert his word will be peace he will make a treaty with the jews which he will break after three and a half years he will have such supernatural power that a mortal wound to his head will be healed even the very elect will be deceived if you do not pray and read the bible you too will be deceived dominate the airwaves perhaps howard stern or rush limbaugh m the antichrist will have a companion the false prohphet sic who will make an image in the likeness of the antichrist and cause it to speak all who refuse to worhsip sic the image will be killed the final three and a half years will be absolutely insane with demonized spirits everywhere x do not give up hope the seven years of tribulation will end with the triumphant return of christ the antichrist will be defeated be steadfast and endure and you will be rewarded greatly in heaven start reading the bible and praying fervently now the salvation of your sould depends upon it determine that come what may you will not take the mark or worship the

six five eight ap mchp sni de in article simon dcs warwick ac uk simon clippingdale writes in article frank d zero one two s six five eight uucp frank o dwyer writes in article simon dcs warwick ac uk simon clippingdale writes i write imagine that one zero zero zero zero zero zero alterian dollars turn up in your bank account every month suppose further that this money is being paid to you by a your big hearted alterian benefactor or b a bug in an alterian atm let s suppose that this is a true dichotomy so p a p b one trouble is alterius is in a different universe so that no observations of alterius are possible except for the banks you couldn t possibly afford it now let s examine the case for a there is no evidence whatsoever that there is any such thing as a big hearted alterian benefactor however p exists b h a b p not exists b h a b one on the grounds that lack of evidence for is evidence against when we have a partition like that we dismiss hypothesis a turning therefore to b we also find no evidence to support that hypothesis on the same grounds as before we dismiss hypothesis b the problem with this is that we have dismissed all of the possible hypotheses and even though we know by construction that the money arrives every month we have proven that it can t because we have dismissed all of its potential causes that s an extremely poor argument and here s why premise one this money is being paid to you by either a your big hearted alterian benefactor or b a bug in an alterian atm thus each monthly appearance of the bucks should it happen is an observation on alterius and by construction is evidence for the existence of either the benefactor or the bug in the atm premise two no observations on alterius are possible except for the banks you couldn t possibly afford it you forgot to include this my premise is actually premise two the cardinality of the set of possible observations on alterius is one this is clearly contradictory to the first not if you state it properly trouble is on the basis of premise two you say that there can be no evidence of either the benefactor or the bug but the first premise leads to the conclusion that the appearance of the bucks should it happen is evidence for the existence of either the benefactor or the bug voila a screaming contradiction with my highlights sc but in a strawman argument there is only evidence for oneof benefactor bug no observation to distinguish benefactor from bug is possible that is not evidence for bug and neither is it evidence for benefactor nor is true to say that this hypothetical universe appears exactly as if there were no benefactor bug two statements both would be false this is still contradictory it reduces to one alterian dosh arriving in my account is due to benefactor or bug two this is not evidence for benefactor neither is it evidence for bug meaning that it doesn t lend more weight to one than to the other three therefore no evidence can exist for benefactor and no evidence can exist for bug but three relies on a shift in meaning from two when you say paraphrased in two that this is not evidence for benefactor for example what you mean is that it s no more evidence for benefactor than it is for bug yes that s what i mean in three however you ve shifted the meaning of evidence for benefactor so that it now means absolute evidence for benefactor rather than relative evidence for benefactor w r t bug not really i meant evidence that would tend to one over the other i think this is just a communications problem what i am trying to say in my clumsy way is that while i buy your theory as far as it relates to theism making predictions prayer your rapture example i don t buy your use of occam s razor in all cases where a zero in my example one couldn t dismiss benefactor or bug on the grounds of simplicity one of these is necessary to explain the dosh i brought up the one by one dismissal process to show that it would be wrong to do so from what you re saying in this post it seems you agree and we re talking at cross purposes three is still in contradiction to one some sums may help with b benefactor b bug d dosh arrives in account one implies p b b d one assuming that p bb d zero so it s either the benefactor or a bug which is responsible if the bucks arrive but not both then p b b d p b d p b d so p b d p b d one but three implies that p b d zero and p b d zero no this isn t what i meant p b d zero five and p b d zero five with necessarily no new observation we ve already seen the dosh to change those estimates i was trying to say again in my clumsy way that it would be wrong to assign zero probability to either of these and that s precisely what use of the razor does in the case of gods gods are one class of hypothesis there are many others belonging to a set of hypotheses one of which is necessary to explain something which otherwise would not be satisfactorily explained it can be thrown out or retained on grounds of non rational preference not of science or statistics alternatively one could chuck out or retain the lot on the grounds that the answer can t be known or that the notional probability estimates are effectively useless being equal agnosticism weak atheism as they do when the set m is filled by the universe is caused by x where x is gods pink unicorns nothing etc and no observation tends to one conclusion over the other exactly the point i was making i think so we don t throw out any of these contrary to your assertion above that we do some people do simon and they think they are doing excellent science my sole point was that they aren t only observations which directly contradict the hypothesis hi i e x where p x hi zero can cause p hi to go to zero after a finite number of observations only in this case do we get to throw any of the hypotheses out exactly my point though i may have been unclear you said the diametric opposite which i guess is the source of my confusion i was merely trying to illustrate the incorrectness of doing so what i m trying to say is that while you are correct to say that absence of evidence can sometimes be evidence of absence this does not hold true for all or perhaps any versions of theism and it isn t true that those for which it does not hold can be discarded using the razor on the contrary those for which it does not hold are exactly those which can be discarded using the razor see my post on the other branch of this thread then you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of if the razor holds for gods then it holds for all like hypotheses which means that you re assigning p x hi zero for all i though we ve already established that it s not correct to do so when sum p x hi one over all i simply put anyone who claims to have a viable proof of the existence or non existence of gods whether inductive or no is at best mistaken and at worst barking mad luckily i make no such claim and have specifically said as much on numerous occasions you wouldn t be constructing a strawman here would you frank although that doesn t of course rule out my being barking mad in any case i could be barking mad in my spare time with apologies to cleese et al but i think you miss the point once again when i say that something is evidence against an hypothesis that doesn t imply that observation of the said something necessarily falsifies the hypothesis reducing the estimate of p h data to zero if it reduces this quantity it s still evidence against h no i got that i m talking about the case when a zero you re clearly correct when a zero and i m not constructing a strawman though it s certainly possible that i ve misunderstood what you re saying however by any standards a system that says when a zero gods are highly unlikely and when a zero gods can be dismissed using the razor is a system purporting to be an inductive proof that gods either don t exist or are unnecessary to explain any or all phenomena in my experience systems such as this including those which purport to prove that gods exist always contain a fallacy upon close examination if that s not what you re saying then

 from acooper mac cc macalstr edu turin turambar me department of utter misery subject re faith and dogma organization macalester college lines one two three in article tgk cs toronto edu todd kelley writes in light of what happened in waco i need to get something of my chest sadly understandable faith and dogma are dangerous yes religion inherently encourages the implementation of faith and dogma and for that reason i scorn religion to be fair you should really qualify this as semitic western religions but you basically go ahead and do this later on anyway i have expressed this notion in the past some christians debated with me whether christianity leaves any room for reasoning i claimed rationality is quelled out of christianity by faith and dogma again this should really be evaluated at a personal level for example there was only one jesus presumably and he probably didn t say all that many things and yet seemingly billions and billions of christian sects have arisen perhaps there is one that is totally dedicated to rationalism and believes in christ as in pantheism it would seem to go against the bible but it is amazing what people come up with under the guise of personal interpretation a philosopher cannot be a christian because a philosopher can change his mind whereas a christian cannot due to the nature of faith and dogma present in any religion this is a good point we have here the quintessential christian he sets up a system of values beliefs for himself which work very well and every event experience is understandable and deablable within the framework of this system however we also have an individual who has the inability at least not without some difficulty to change which is important because the problem with such a system is the same as with any system one cannot be open minded to the point of testing hypotheses against the basic premise of the system without destroying whatever faith is invested therein unless of course all the tests fail in other words the fairer way would be to test and evaluate moralities without the bias responsibility of losing retaining a system i claimed that a christian philosopher is not a christian but is a person whose beliefs at the moment correspond with those of christianity consider that a person visiting or guarding a prison is not a prisoner unless you define a prisoner simply to be someone in a prison can we define a prisoner to be someone who at the moment is in a prison can we define a christian to be someone who at the moment has christian beliefs no because if a person is free to go he is not a prisoner similarly if a person is not constrained by faith and dogma he is not a christian interesting but again when it seems to basically boil down to individual nuances although not always i will admit and probably it is the mass oriented divisions which are the most appalling it becomes irrelevant unfortunately i admit it s a word game i m going by the dictionary definition of religion religion n one concern over what exists beyond the visible world differentiated from philosophy in that it operates through faith or intuition rather than reason webster s now let s go beyond the word game i don t claim that religion causes genocide i think that if all humans were atheist there would still be genocide there will always be humans who don t think there will always be humans who don t ask themselves what is the real difference between themselves and people with different colored skin or a different language or different beliefs granted religion is like the gun that doesn t kill anybody religion encourages faith and dogma and although it doesn t directly condemn people it encourages the use of just because thinking it is just because thinking that kills people in which case the people become the bullets and the religion as the gun merely offers them a way to more adequately do some harm with themselves if i may be so bold as to extend your similie sure religion has many good qualities it encourages benevolence and philanthropy ok so take out only the bad things like faith dogma and tradition put in the good things like careful reasoning and science the result is secular humanism wouldn t it be nice if everyone were a secular humanist to please the supernaturalists you might even leave god in there but the secular emphasis would cause the supernaturalists to start thinking and they too would realize that a belief in a god really doesn t put anyone further ahead in understanding the universe ok i m just poking fun at the supernaturalists also understandable of course not all humans are capable of thought and we d still have genocide and maybe even some mass suicide but not as much i m willing to bet on that todd todd kelley tgk cs toronto

 from mathew subject re death penalty gulf war long organization mantis consultants cambridge uk x newsreader rusnews v one zero two lines one five eight jbrown batman bmd trw com writes i don t regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made which affect the lives of innocent people but i do regret the circumstances which make those decisions necessary and i regret the suffering caused by those decisions i m afraid i m going to have to kill you don t worry though as a loving christian i guarantee that i will regret the fact that i have to kill you although i won t regret the actual killing if we hadn t intervened allowing hussein to keep kuwait then it would have been appeasement right but did you ever hear anyone advocate such a course of action or are you just setting up a strawman i m not setting up a strawman at all if you want to argue against the war then the only logical alternative was to allow hussein to keep kuwait false dichotomy diplomatic alternatives including sanctions were ineffective that s because they weren t even attempted but what about those who didn t support hitler s dreams of conquest it s not as if they democratically voted for all his policies the nsdap got four three in the elections of one nine three three and that was the last chance the german people got to vote on the matter they suffered along with the rest why does this bother you so much you want to know why it bothers me that thousands of innocent people were maimed or killed by bombing at the end of ww two when it was far from clear that such bombing was necessary the world is full of evil and circumstances are not perfect many innocents suffer due to the wrongful actions of others it it regretable but that s the way it is and why is it that way who set things up to be that way this was happening before the gulf war why didn t we send in the bombers to east timor why aren t we sending in the bombers now probably because we re not the saviors of the world we can t police each and every country that decides to self destruct or invade another no just the ones that have oil or the ones that look like they might make a success of communism nor are we in a strategic position to get relief to tibet east timor or some other places i don t see that getting un forces to east timor is any harder than getting them to iraq tibetan people are rounded up tortured and executed amnesty international recently reported that torture is still widespread in china why aren t we stopping them in fact why are we actively sucking up to them by trading freely with them tell me how we could stop them and i ll support it i for one do not agree with the present us policy of sucking up to them as you put it i agree that it is deplorable fine write to your congressman and to president clinton china s status as most favoured nation comes up for renewal in june point out that the us shouldn t be offering favourable trading terms to such a despicable regime i doubt anything will happen clinton s keener on trade sanctions against europe unbelievable comments about the rodney king case deleted the media is not totally monolithic even though there is a prevailing liberal bias programs such as the macneil lehrer news hour try to give a balanced and fair reporting of the news there are even conservative sources out there if you know where to look hurrah for rush any idea how many kill files you just ended up in i an atheist am arguing against killing innocent people you a supposed christian are arguing that it s ok to kill innocent people so long as you get some guilty ones as well hardly i didn t say that it s a good thing tm to kill innocent people if the end is just unfortunately we don t live in a perfect world and there are no perfect solutions if one is going to resist tyranny then innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die i didn t say it is ok it is unfortunate but sometimes necessary the ends justify the means eh you having criticised moral relativism in the past are now arguing that i am in no position to judge the morality of allied actions at the end of the war you certainly are not in such a position if you are a moral relativist the same tired old misunderstanding moral relativism means that there is no objective standard of morality it doesn t mean you can t judge other people s morals christ on a bike how many times have we tried to hammer that into your head where s your christian love where s your absolute morality oh how quick you are to discard them when it suits you as ivan stang would say jesus would puke one day i will stand before jesus and give account of every word and action even this discourse in this forum i understand the full ramifications of that and i am prepared to do so i don t believe that you can make the same claim obviously not as i am an atheist i don t think you d get on with jesus though he was a long haired lunatic peace nik was he not and btw the reason i brought up the blanket bombing in germany was because you were bemoaning the iraqi civilian casualties as being so deplorable yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing wasn t accurate enough to hit industrial military targets in a decisive way by any other method at that time but in the gulf war precision bombing was the norm so the point was why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted in spite of precision bombing when so many more civilians proportionately and quantitatively died under the blanket bombing in ww two right unfortunately for you it turned out that my opinions on the matter were entirely consistent in that i condemned the bombing of dresden too i think you re being a bit glib with your explanation of the blanket bombing policy too you make it sound as though we were aiming for military targets and could only get them by destroying civilian buildings next door as i understand it that is not the case we aimed deliberately at civilian targets in order to cause massive damage and inspire terror amongst the german people civilians suffer but less civilians suffered in this war than any other iany other in history oh come on with wars like the falklands fresh in people s minds that sort of propaganda isn t going to fool anyone the stories of hundreds of thousands of iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk yes bunk the us lost two three zero zero zero zero servicemen in ww two over four years and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting yes and what about the millions of casualties the russians suffered it s hardly surprising the us didn t lose many men in ww two given that you turned up late mathew

 from kempmp phoenix oulu fi petri pihko subject re consciousness part ii kev strikes back organization university of oulu finland x newsreader tin version one one pl nine lines two zero seven kevin anthoney kax cs nott ac uk wrote about my reply diplomatic it a society that is constantly on the verge of flaming usenet diplomacy is the best way to ensure the voice of reason gets through isn t it i realize i m fighting occam s razor in this argument so i ll try to explain why i feel a mind is necessary kevin unfortunately you are now delving into field i know too little about algorithms your reasoning as i see it is very much along the lines of roger penrose who claimed that mathematical insight cannot be algorithmic in his book the emperor s new mind concerning computers minds and the laws of physics however penrose s claim that he has mathematical insight or your similar claim that wavefunctions collapse only when we consciously take a look could be just illusions we are obviouslu taking very different viewpoints i try to ponder on the problem of consciousness from an evolutionary perspective realising that it might not be anything special but certainly useful thinking back of what i wrote do you think worms have minds or not they are able to experience pain at least they behave just like that yet it is conceivable that we might some day in the future perform a total synthesis of c elegans from the elements would such a worm have a mind firstly i m not impressed with the ability of algorithms they re great at solving problems once the method has been worked out but not at working out the method itself this is true to some extent however i do not think that our brains work like computers at all in fact there is substantial evidence skarda one nine eight five skarda freeman one nine eight seven that brains work more or less chaotically generating enough randomness for mental states to evolve our brains work much like genetic algorithm generators i suppose the trick still has to be there in some form to be discovered does this mean that all the ideas we will ever have are already pre programmed into our brains this is somewhat unlikely given that our brains ultimately are encoded in four six chromosomes worth of genetic material much of which isn t used indeed this is extremely unlikely given the vast impact of nurture on our mind and brain i suggest however that before trying to understand our consciousness as a collection of algorithms kevin take a look at the references i mentioned and think again i still think the best experts on the nature of a conscious mind are neurologists neuropsychologists and biologists but do not flame me for my opinions since they study beings that are conscious the reason i am repeating my advice is that this discussion cannot lead to anywhere if our backgrounds are too different and please do not bring qm into this discussion at all not all physicists are happy with the claim that our consciousness plays some special role in physics i would say it doesn t the other problem with algorithms is their instability not many algorithms survive if you take out a large portion of their code yet people survive strokes without going completely haywire there are side effects but patients still seem remarkably stable also neurons in perfectly healthy people are dying at an alarming rate can an algorithm survive if i randomly corrupt various bits of it s code again brains are not computers don t forget this this does not mean they need something else to work they just work differently their primary purpose is perception and guidance of action self awareness and high intelligence are later appearances the next problem is the sticky question of what is colour replace colour with the sensation of your choice presumably the materialist viewpoint is that it s the product of some kind of chemical reaction the usual products of such a reaction are energy different chemicals is colour a mixture of these you are still expecting that we could find the idea of green in our brains somewhere perhaps in the form of some chemical this is not how i see it the sensation green is a certain time dependent pattern in the area v four of our visual cortex and it is distributed with the help of areas v one and v two to the rest of the brain indeed a firing pattern i have sometimes thought of our consciousness as a global free induction pattern of these local firing patterns but this is just idle speculation scientific american s september one nine nine two issue was a special issue on mind and brain have you already read it from cover to cover there are two articles on visual perception so you might be interested but again please note that subjective experiences cannot be observed from a third person perspective if we see nothing but neuronal activity we cannot go on to conclude that this is not the mind kalat one nine eight eight writes about numerous examples where electric stimulation of different areas of brain have led to various changes in the patients state of mind for instance a patient whose septal area was stimulated without his knowledge by remote control during a psychiatric interview was quickly cured of his depression and started discussing a plan to seduce his girlfriend stimulations in the temporal lobe have sometimes led to embarrassing situations when the patients have started flirting with the therapist in conclusion there is evidence that one brains are essentially necessary for subjective experiences brain damage is usually equivalent to some sort of mind damage two conscious processes involve substantial brain activity in various areas of brain when we think of colours our visual cortex is activated etc three consciousness is an afterthought we become conscious of our actions with a half a second delay and our brains are ahead of our conscious will by at least three five zero ms thus i think it is fruitful to turn the question why do i see colours around and ask what is this i that seems to be observing since it seems that our conscious mind is not the king of our brains if this is so a computer won t see colour because the chemistry is different does an algorithm that sees colour have a selective advantage over an equivalent that doesn t it shouldn t because the outputs of each algorithm ought to be the same in equivalent circumstances so why do we see colour this depends on what is meant by seeing colours does a neural network that is capable of recognising handwritten numbers from zero to nine see the numbers if it is capable of sorting them if you are asking why does an animal who is conscious of itself as an observer have an evolutionary advantage over an animal who doesn t i have a good answer read my previous posting where i wrote why a sense of identity helps social animals to swap roles and act more morally so that they don t unconsciously kill each other with newly discovered weapons a bit extreme but this is the basic idea when early homo became more and more efficient in using tools a sense of identity and the concept of self had to evolve in line with this development indeed respect for others and conscious altruistic behaviour might be evolutionary advantages for social animals such as early humans if i remember correctly quantum mechanics consists of a wavefunction with two processes acting on it the first process has been called unitary evolution or u is governed by schroedinger s equation and is well known the second process called various things such as collapse of the wavefunction or state vector reduction or r and is more mysterious it is usually said to occur when a measurement takes place although nobody seems to know precisely when that occurs when it does occur the effect of r is to abruptly change the wavefunction if minds are required for this does this mean that until human minds came to the scene wavefunctions never collapsed but remained in the superpositions for aeons my how powerful we are this has been discussed before and i think this topic is irrelevant since we do not agree that minds are necessary and neither do physicists anyway i m speculating that minds would be in part x there seems to be some link between consciousness and r in that we never see linear superpositions of anything although there are alternative explainations for this i ve no idea how a brain is supposed to access part x but since this is only speculation that won t matter too much my main point is that there might be a place for minds in physics i agree but not in the sense you apparently mean above physics needs sharp minds to solve many real problems i ll go back to my nice padded cell now if that s ok with you it s ok if you don t

 from rashid subject re yet more rushdie re islamic law nntp posting host four seven two five two four one eight six organization nh lines one two six in article davec silicon csci csusb edu dave choweller wrote in article rashid writes stuff deleted the point of my post was that rushdie was not being condemned solely for the words in his book although this was certainly a contributing factor it was the whole series of actions of rushdie and his publishers following the publication of the book and the initial media spotlight placed on the book that in large part led to the fatwa the kind of fatwa levelled against rushdie is not lightly placed and there are any number of anti islamic writers both within and outside the islamic world who have not had fatwas made against them here someone who adds fuel to an explosive situation might be charged with incitement to riot if people die in the rioting the charges against him might become even more serious how can rushdie be blamed for the deaths of people who are demonstrating against him the deaths should be blamed on the people who dealt with the demonstrations or on the demonstrators themselves if they were violent to what lengths will you go to justify this barbaric behaviour against rushdie once the rushdie situation exploded into the media the muslim voice on the matter of the book was effectively restricted to short video bytes showing the dramatic highlights of muslim demonstrations for every twenty or so newspaper magazine articles interviews etc supporting rushdie there would appear one muslim voice this person was usually selected based on how dramatic and incoherent he was not on his knowledge of islam or the situation at the time this approx twenty to one ratio continued throughout the escalation of the crisis with rushdie in the central spotlight as the man of the moment the valiant defender of everyman s right to free speech decoupled from responsibility as an aside it s interesting that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up some books defaming certain ethnic and religious groups continued to be banned here it was felt that they injured the sensibilities of these groups and presented a false image which could promote feelings of hate towards these groups for muslims this kind of double standard was annoying rushdie saw this spotlight as a golden opportunity to lash out at organized islam and he did so with admirable verbal skill the only kind of islam which rushdie finds palatable is what he calls a secular islam an islam separated from it s qur an it s prophet god its legislation and most importantly from any intrusion into any political arena fine rushdie made his views known the muslim s made their anger at his book known the scale of the whole affair erupted into global proportions it was by this time already a political situation affecting governments as well as individuals the situation was a serious one with far reaching political implications at the centre of this turmoil was rushdie throwing fuel on the fire engaged in a personal crusade that made him oblivious to any sense of caution now you may feel that the person in the centre of a worldwide storm such as this has no responsibility has no reason to exercise restraint of any kind has no obligation to perhaps step back momentarily out of the spotlight till matters calm down perhaps you even feel that he is justified in boldly defying the anger of all those who dare to take umbrage at his literary work no matter what insult they find within it perhaps you see him as a kind of secular heroic knight mounted on the his media steed doing battle with the dragon of islamic fundamentalism well khomeini saw him as a disingeneous author who grew up in a muslim atmosphere knew well what muslim s hold dear who wrote a book which mischievously uses certain literary conventions to slander insult and attack islam and its most notable personalities who when faced with a situation that became a worldwide crisis continued with his mischief in the world stage of the media who even after people were injured and killed because of the magnitude and emotion of the situation continued his mischief instead of having the good sense to desist khomeini saw the crisis as mischief making on a grand scale mischief making that grew in scale as the scale of the crisis enlarged the deaths of muslims around the world and rushdie s continued media mischief even after this was the triggering factor that seemed to decide khomeini on putting a stop to the mischief the person at the centre of all these events was rushdie he was the source of the continuing mischief all media support government support was just that support the source was rushdie and his publishers who were nothing short of ecstatic at the publicity and were very happy to see rushdie constantly in the media the islamic rulings that deal with people who engage in this kind of grand scale mischief making was applied to rushdie you re attempts at justification are not doing the image of islam any good i have made no attempts at justification only at explanation image is the chief concern of muslim apologists for islam and for rushdie if muslims willingly relegated themselves to becoming a sub culture within a larger secular culture such that the secular principles and laws had precedence over the laws of islam then i have no doubt that islam would then be thought to have a good image principally because it would by and large reflect the secular image a good image usually means be more like me your attempts at totally exonerating rushdie reflect exactly the attitude that resulted in the polarization brought about by the crisis in iran the situation was monitored for many months when rushdie kept adding fuel to the flames through the free worldwide voice that the media gave him the situation was monitored more seriously when even after many deaths occured worldwide rushdie still did not desist the fatwa was pronounced when behaving like a total jerk endangers lives and the jerk sees this and still insists on his right to behave like a total jerk he has the rug jerked out from under him if the muslims didn t make such a big fuss over the book like issuing death threats and killing publishers no one would have heard of it the fatwa came later much later if rushdie didn t mouth off so much in the media the fuss would have died down no one would have been killed no fatwa would have been passed the whole episode would have fizzled away

five in article frank d zero one two s six five eight uucp frank o dwyer writes theism is strongly correlated with irrational belief in absolutes irrational belief in absolutes is strongly correlated with fanatism deletion theism is correlated with fanaticism i have neither said that all fanatism is caused by theism nor that all theism leads to fanatism the point is theism increases the chance of becoming a fanatic one could of course argue that would be fanatics tend towards theism for example but i just have to loook at the times in history when theism was the dominant ideology to invalidate that conclusion that that is the basic mechanism behind it imo the influence of stalin or for that matter ayn rand invalidates your assumption that theism is the factor to be considered bogus i just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism the point is that theism is a factor gullibility blind obedience to authority lack of scepticism and so on are all more reliable indicators and the really dangerous people the sources of fanaticism are often none of these things they are cynical manipulators of the gullible who know precisely what they are doing that s a claim you have to support please note that especially in the field of theism the leaders believe what they say now some brands of theism and more precisely some theists do tend to fanaticism i grant you to tar all theists with this brush is bigotry not a reasoned argument and it reads to me like a warm up for censorship and restriction of religious freedom ever read animal farm that s a straw man and as usually in discussions with you one has to repeat it read what i have written above not every theism leads to fanatism and not all fanatism is caused by theism the point is there is a correlation and it comes from innate features of theism gullibility by the way is one of them and to say that i am going to forbid religion is another of your straw men interesting that you have nothing better to offer two define irrational belief e g is it rational to believe that reason is always useful irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason the latter has been discussed for a long time with charley wingate one point is that the beliefs violate reason often and another that a process that does not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable information well there is a glaring paradox here an argument that reason is useful based on reason would be circular and argument not based on reason would be irrational which is it that s bogus self reference is not circular and since the evaluation of usefulness is possible within rational systems it is allowed your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics and mathematics are therfore circular the first part of the second statement contains no information because you don t say what the beliefs are if the beliefs are strong theism and or strong atheism then your statement is not in general true the second part of your sentence is patently false counterexample an axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis but is assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is used to obtain it i ve been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions of god here an axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis what you say here is a an often refuted fallacy have a look at the discussion of the axiom of choice and further one can evaluate axioms in larger systems out of which they are usually derived i exist is derived if you want it that way further one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms what is it you are trying to say compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational i can t agree with this until you are specific which theism to say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which i suspect you do not have using the traditonal definition of gods personal supernatural entities with objective effects on this world usually connected to morals and or the way the world works the affinity to fanatism is easily seen it has to be true because i believe it is nothing more than a work hypothesis however the beliefs say they are more than a work hypothesis i don t understand this can you formalise your argument person a believes system b becuase it sounds so nice that does not make b true it is at best a work hypothesis however the content of b is that it is true and that it is more than a work hypothesis testing or evaluating evidence for or against it therefore dismissed because b already believed says it is wrong a waste of time not possible depending on the further contents of b amalekites idolaters protestants are to be killed this can have interesting effects answer the question what the absolute set of morals is people agree on like they would agree on a football being a football benedikt

didn t know it before i follow your proof but i have one questions we have two hypotheses h and hg the latter is more complicated which by definition means p h p hg that complicated isn t in fact where p h p hg comes from it s more the other way around it s from p h p hg p hg where g is the complement of g and by axiom p anything zero so p hg zero so p h p hg in a sense hg is necessarily more complicated than h for any h and g so i may be splitting hairs but what i m trying to say is that irrespective of subjective impressions of how complicated something is p h p hg holds with equality if and only if p hg zero as you point out it s a very simple matter to show p x h p x hg p h x p hg x and thus h is to be preferd to hg now to say that h is as consistent with the data as hg is to say p x h p x hg can you elaborate some on this well p x a p x b means that x is as likely to be observed if a is operative as it is if b is operative this implies that observing x does not provide any useful information which might allow us to discriminate between the respective possibilities that a and b are operative the difference reduces to the difference between the unknown and unhelpful prior probabilities p a and p b p x a p x b p a x k p a and p b x k p b where k p x a p x p x b p x so a and b are equally consistent with the data in that observing x doesn t give any pointers as to which of a or b is operative in the particular case where a h and b hg however we know that their prior probabilities are ordered by p h p hg although we don t know the actual values and it s this which allows us to deploy the razor to throw out any such hg also in the real world it isn t as clear cut and dry it seems to me we can t always determine whether the equality p x h p x hg is true that s certainly true but the particular point here was whether or not a divine component actually underlies the prevalence of religion in addition to the memetic transmission component which even the religious implicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of spreading the word now it seems to me as i ve said that the observed variance in religious belief is well accounted for by the memetic transmission model but rather less well if one proposes a divine component in addition since i would expect the latter to conspire against wide variance and even mutual exclusion among beliefs thus my personal feeling is that p x hg isn t even equal to p x h in this case but is smaller h is memetic transmission g is divine component x is the variance among beliefs but i happily acknowledge that this is a subjective impression btw my beef with your baysian argument was not a mathematical one i checked most of your work and didn t find an error and you seem very careful so there probably isn t a math mistake i think the mistake is philosophical but just to make sure i understand you can please rephrase it in non technical terms i think this is a reasonable request i always try to look for ways of explaining physics to non physicist i m not a baysian statistician nor any type of statistician so this would be very helpful not that i m a statistician as such either but the idea is that both theism and atheism are compatible with all of the read my observations to date however theism of the type with which i am concerned also suggests that for instance prayer may be answered people may be miraculously healed both are in principle amenable to statistical verification and that god s may generally intervene in measurable ways this means that these regions of the space of possible observations which i loosely termed appearances of god s have some nonzero probability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic since there is only so much probability available for each hypothesis to scatter around over the observation space the probability which theism expends on making appearances of god s possible must come from somewhere else i e other possible observations all else being equal this means that an observation which isn t an appearance of god s must have a slightly higher probability under atheism than under theism the bayesian stuff implies that such observations must cause my running estimate for the probability of the atheistic hypothesis to increase with a corresponding decrease in my running estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis sorry if that s still a bit jargonesque but it s rather difficult to put it any other way since it does depend intimately on the properties of conditional probability densities and particularly that the total area under them is always unity an analogy may or may not be helpful say that hypothesis a is the coin is fair and that b is the coin is unfair two headed i ve used a and b to avoid confusion with hheads and ttails then p h a zero five total one p t a zero five p h b one total one p t b zero the observations are a string of heads with no tails this is compatible with both a fair coin a and a two headed coin b however the probability expended by a on making possible the appearance of tails even though they don t actually appear must come from somewhere else since the total must be unity and it comes in this case from the probability of the appearance of heads say our running estimates at time n one are en one a and en one b the observation xn at time n is another head xn h the estimates are modified according to p h a en a en one a en one a m p h and p h b en b en one b en one b two m p h now we don t know p h the actual prior probability of a head but the multiplier for e a is half that for e b this is true every time the coin is tossed and a head is observed thus whatever the initial values of the estimates after n heads we have n en a m e zero a and n en b two m e zero b and since ek a ek b one at any time k you can show that zero five constant observation of no evidence for gods if evidence for them is at all possible under the respective theisms constantly increases the notional estimated probability that they don t exist it s important to draw a distinction between theism that could be supported or not supported by evidence and theism that can t given a theism for which evidence is in principle not possible it doesn t make sense to say lack of evidence supports the contrary view quite so but this type of theism is what i might call the g in the hg in terms of our ockham s razor discussion and i d bin it on those grounds so it depends upon your conception of this god if it s a conception like zeus who happened to come down to earth to play quite frequently then i agree with you lack of evidence for this conception of god is evidence that it does not exist but if your conception of god is one that does not make falsifiable predictions see below on falsifiable predictions then i disagree lack of evidence does not support a disbelief the hypotheses don t have to be falsifiable and indeed in my model the theism isn t falsifiable i used the phrase should obverse given any specific x theism does not make the prediction p x ht zero that s why i used the word should theism makes no predictions about any specific event i can only say i believe that god did such and such after such and such happens or i believe god will do such and such but for any given x i can never a priori say p x ht zero i can not even say this for the set of all x or some x this is what don t like about your use of probability we also have no way of assigning these probabilities i hold science to positivistic criteria if someone cannot tell me how to measure even in principle p x h then probability is not applicable to hypothesis h such is the case when h ht theistic and ha atheistic for example p x ha p x ha p ha what is p ha how do i measure it you don t have to we don t need in the above analogy to know any prior probabilities to deduce that the updating multiplier for the fair coin hypothesis is less than unity and that the corresponding multiplier for the two headed coin hypothesis is greater than unity you don t need to know the initial values of the running estimates either it s clear that after a large number of observations p fair coin approaches zero and p two headed coin approaches unity all you need to know is whether p x ha is larger than p x ht for observed x and this follows from the assumptions that there are certain events rendered possible not necessary under ht which are not possible under ha and all else is equal baysian statistics relies upon a series of observations but what if the hypothesis isn t amenable to observation and even for statements that are amenable to observation some observations are not relevant a sequence of observations must be chosen with care i m curious to know what types of observations x one x two you have in mind concerning theism and atheism any observations you like it really doesn t matter nor affect the reasoning provided that there are some possible observations which would count as appearances of god s examples of this might be a demonstration of the efficacy of prayer or of the veracity of revelation but any statement about p x h for general x still counts as a prediction of h if the theism in question ht says that prayer may be answered or that miracles may happen see my interpretation quoted again above of what god exists means then this is a prediction p x ht zero for such x it s what distinguishes it from the atheist hypothesis ha which predicts that this stuff does not happen p x ha zero for such x theism does not make the claim that p x ht zero for such x or i should say that my theism doesn t maybe i was too quick to say we had a common language you said that by the existence of god you mean the notion that the deity described by the bible and by christians does interact with the universe as claimed by those agents i agreed with this however i must be careful here i believe this i m not making any claims maybe i should have changed does to can there is an important shift of emphasis but any way since i only have a belief i cannot conclude p x ht zero for such x ok we ll downgrade does interact to may interact which would actually be better since does interact implies a falsifiability which we both agree is misplaced i don t think my theism makes predictions maybe i m not understanding what you mean by prediction could you explain what you mean by this word i ll explain but bear in mind that this isn t central all i require of a theism is that it not make the prediction appearances of god s will never happen as does atheism before somebody points out that quantum mechanics doesn t make this prediction either the difference is that qm and atheism do not form a partition predictions include such statements as prayer is efficacious implying if you do the stats you will find that prayer is efficacious or prayer is not efficacious or verily i say unto you this generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled i don t think we have any problems of misunderstanding here persistent observation of this stuff not happening consistent with ht though it may be is more consistent with ha as explained in the bayesian stats post even if ht god exists is unfalsifiable that s no problem for my argument other than that you have to let the number of observations go to infinity to falsify it asymptotically btw i do not consider an argument that requires an infinite number of observations as valid or rather that part of the argument is not valid we as existing humans can never make an infinite number of measurments and any conclusion that reilies on this i don t accept as valid that s fine i don t claim that theism is false merely that the finite number of observations available to me so far suggest that it is and that as i continue to observe the suggestion looks better and better renormalization stuff deleted in the bayesian stats post i assumed that theism was indeed unfalsifiable in a finite number of observations here s the relevant quote the important assumption is that there are some observations which are compatible with the theist hypothesis and not with the atheist hypothesis and thus would falsify atheism these are what i called appearances of god s but this need not be taken too literally any observation which requires for its explanation that one or more gods exist will count all other observations are assumed to be compatible with both hypotheses this leaves theism as unfalsifiable and atheism as falsifiable in a single observation only by such appearances of god s here is my problem with this for something to be falsifiable it must make the prediction that x should not be seen if x is seen then the hypothesis has been falsified now atheism is a word in oposition to something theism a theism aserts a belief and an atheism aserts a disbelief so there are certain atheisms that are certainly falsifiable just as there are certain theisms that are falsifable e g if my theism asserts the world is only six zero zero zero years old and that god does not decieve then this has been falsified however the atheism that is in oposition to an unfalsifiable theism is also unfalsifiable i could be wrong on this statment contd i think you are an appearance of god s is sufficient to falsify atheism whereas in general the corresponding theism is unfalsifiable i ll think more about it until then here is a general question suppse x were unfalsifiable is not x also unfalsifiable no by way of a counterexample let x the coin is fair or more accurately so that not x makes sense the two sides of the coin are different this is unfalsifiable by tossing the coin even a string of heads is consistent with a fair coin and you have to go to an infinite number of tosses to falsify x in the limit its converse is falsifiable and is falsified when at least one head and at least one tail have appeared this is partly what s wrong with you baysian argument which requires observations x one xn to be made there are simply no such observations that have a truth value in relation to the statement god exists now by use of your symmetry argument i can understand why someone would say since the statement god does not exist makes no predictions i will choose not to believe it but none the less this would be founded on a type of faith or if you don t like the word faith insert belief for which there is no falsifiable evidence instead i ll assume you meant god exists up there at the highlight but by our agreed definition of exists the statement makes predictions as i said above although it isn t falsifiable in a finite number of observations actually i mean god does not exist makes no predictions oops sorry mea culpa the truth of this statment actually depends upon which god you are refering to but i can think of some conceptions of god for which it is true but once again i m open to the posibility that i could be wrong so give me some examples of predictions of the statment god does not exist here is one that i can think of if true then there would be no healing or miricles but this can in principle never be determined one way or the other there are cases in which people seem to recover and are healed without the help of a doctor and for no known reason these situations do in fact happen they are consistent with a theistic hypothesis but in no way support such a hypothesis we agree here they are not inconsistent with an atheistic hypothesis i can t think of one prediction from god does not exist that isn t of this type but i might be missing something the rapture will not happen on october two eight one nine nine two said rapture would have falsified atheism to my satisfaction had it happened although its failure to happen does not of course falsify any theisms other than those which specifically predicted it no phenomenon which requires the existence of one or more gods for its

to think i m doing so since this is now dated however don t feel compelled to respond in article strom watson ibm com rob strom writes i was making two separate points both of which attack face value bible interpretation one to judge the bible s value today you judge it based on the way it is used today that is what do commentators actually say what do rabbis teach etc i suspect you meant this in context of the jewish tradition you have been referring to one problem with a highly interpreted tradition like this is what happens when a schism occurs and over time certain large and influential branches of the heretical group come to favor exactly a face value interpretation two to judge the bible s value when originally written you a read it in the context of its time not with today s assumptions and b compare it to the practices of surrounding people while the context of the time is important value judgments must ultimately be according to current understanding or at least to some base standard relative stability success of a society e g this is obviously true in comparing it to practices of surrounding people for instance according to the bible the surrounding people were immoral savages with repulsive and inhuman habits we need to look rather at what those peoples were really like for instance in what way is it better to worship a single god whose presence is symbolically strongest in a tent or temple over multiple gods some of whose presence is symbolically represented in a statue by the bible s own terms idolatry is inherently evil but i see no evidence that the followers of the various other religions of the area and time were particularly bad people relative to the people in the bible scissors and cloth now in the past our ancestors did cut cloth with scissors but they at least knew that their inhumane neighbors cut it with their bare teeth so this was a relatively enlightened step forward from their earlier barbarism and made the transition to modern civilized paper cutting that much easier sounds good but it presupposes teeth rending neighbors which i see no support for one can argue that post facto assertion of inhumane neighbors can be used to make moral points but that doesn t mean that the actual neighbors really were inhuman more to the point such dehumanization of the people across the river or over the mountain or even of a different people dwelling among us is all too common that complex and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic interpretations of that history is interesting but i still don t think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it to attack condemnation of the original history note that i m speaking of historical interpretation here for instance claiming that hammurabi s an eye for an eye was primitive brutal retribution while moses version was an enlightened benign fine because the tradition has since interpreted the phrase that way as of three zero zero zero years ago or so they probably both meant the same thing to be sure i m arguing from a parochial perspective i belong to this tiny tribe which has struggled against overwhelming odds for survival as a distinct tribe and this book is the book of my tribe the book commands us to dedicate ourselves to study to improve the world and to set an example as a light to the nations we ve revered the book and i think we ve been successful as scientists as artists and musicians as leaders in important humanitarian causes it s hard for me to separate the success of my people from the virtue of our book you d have to argue that we d have done significantly better with a different book or with no book or that another tribe with a different book or with no book has done significantly better i don t belittle the accomplishments particularly the intellectual ones of the jewish people i have given up on trying to think by analogy since i don t know of any other tribe that is at all similar the closest i can think of are the romany but i don t know enough about them to make a meaningful comparison i think a tradition of reflective study of flexible rather than dogmatic interpretation is a good thing i think that with such an attitude a case could be made that you could have done as well starting with a one nine four three captain america comic or whatever the

do not believe in blindly following anyone no matter how knowledgeable he or she may be in islamic law if someone tells me islam says such and such i immediately say show me the support for this statement from the qur an and sunnah i believe this to be my islamic duty for according to one hadith of the prophet peace and blessings of god be with him if your leader tells you to enter a fire and you do it and kill yourself then you have sinned for doing wrong even though you were blindly following the instructions of your leader i am responsible for my own actions not abu hanifa or imam malik etc even if i am blindly following the opinions of abu hanifa etc with this in mind to my understanding we must look at the reasoning behind such opinions of muslims that support khomeini s fatwa now to my understanding the hadith upon which those who support khomeini s fatwa is relating to a particular instance that occurred during war time now brother in general it is imho ridiculous and wrong to say that a hadith relating to the actions of war is usable during times of peace i think any sensible human being can see this so i personally think that the reasoning of some of our ulema in this matter is faulty for they think it is legitimate to use acts of war in times of peace regarding this particular subject if you think i am wrong please feel free to say so with your reasoning from qur an and hadith please not because somebody said so i want the reasoning from al qur an and the sahih hadiths perhaps we should take our discussion to soc religion islam please email me rashid if you think we should do this by the way i also disagree with your opinion regarding the punishment for apostasy the viewpoint i follow that there is in general no punishment for apostasy is very strongly supported by qur an and hadith this is very well shown in the book punishment in islamic law by mohamed s el awa american trust publications one nine eight one i reiterate that i would agree with you that there is little justification for the punishment of apostasy in the qur an in islamic history as well apostasy has rarely been punished belief is considered a matter of conscience and since there is to be no compulsion in the matter of belief apostates have been generally left to believe or not believe as they will however when an apostate makes attacks upon god and his messenger the situation changes now the charge of apostasy may be complicated with other charges perhaps charges of sedition treason spying etc if the person makes a public issue of their apostasy or mounts public attacks as opposed to arguement against islam the situation is likewise complicated if the person spreads slander or broadcasts falsehoods again the situation changes the punishments vary according to the situation the apostate is in anyhow the charge of aggravated apostasy would only be a subsidiary charge in rushdie s case there is a distinction in the qur an between a formal war situation and being in the situation where someone unilaterally wages war by their actions creates disorder makes mischief etc against the muslims and creates a situation that results in harm to muslims here a small group or even a single individual could be said to be engaged in such a practise in other words there is a clear difference between a formal war situation where two clearly defined parties wage war conclude treaties exchange prisoners etc and dealing with attacks that come from isolated individuals or groups against islam it is the second situation the unilateral attack and the spreading of fasad that would apply in the case of rushdie the matter of rushdie is not a simple matter of banning an offensive book banning the book is secondary a full set of circumstances following the publication of the book come into play as well including the deaths of many muslims and rushdie s and his publishers media games now i do not believe in blindly following anyone no matter how knowledgeable he or she may be in islamic law if someone tells me islam says such and such i immediately say show me the support for this statement from the qur an and sunnah i believe this to be my islamic duty for according to one hadith of the prophet peace and blessings of god be with him if your leader tells you to enter a fire and you do it and kill yourself then you have sinned for doing

of our ulema in this matter is faulty for they think it is legitimate to use acts of war in times of peace regarding this particular subject i am not sure which hadith you are referring to above i believe that one of the qur anic verses on which the fatwa is based is five three three every verse in the qur an has a corresponding circumstance of revelation but in no way is the understanding the tafsir of the verse restricted solely to the particular historical circumstance in which it was revealed if this was the case then we could say that all the laws and regulations that were revealed when the muslims were not involved in conflict should be suspended when they were at war the logic does not follow in complex real life situations there may be many verses and many hadiths which can all be related to a single complicated situation the internal relationships between these verses may be quite complex such that arriving at an understanding of how the verses interlock and how each applies to the particular situation can be quite a demanding task it is not necessarily a simple this or that process there may be many parameters involved there may be a larger context in which a particular situation should be viewed all these matters impinge on the situation in other words there is a great deal involved in deciphering the qur an the qur an asks us to reflect on its verses but this reflection must entail more than simply reading a verse and its corresponding hadith if the reflection is for the sake of increasing personal piety then each person has his own level of understanding and there is no harm in that however if the reflection is in order to decide matters that pertain to the state to the gestation of laws and rulings to the gestation of society the dispensing of justice the guidance of the community then there are certain minimum requirements of understanding that one should achieve jaffar ibn muhammad as sadiq a s relates some of these requirements as taught by the prophet s a in a hadith he who does not distinguish in the book of allah the abrogating verse from the abrogated one and a specific one from a general one and a decisive from an ambiguous and does not differentiate between a permission and an obligation and does not recognize a verse of meccan period from a medinite one and does not know the circumstances of revelation and does not understand the technical words of the qur an whether simple or compound and does not comprehend the knowledge of decree and measure and is ignorant of advancing and delaying in its verses and does not distinguish the clear from the deep nor the manifest from the esoteric nor the beginning from the termination and is unaware of the question and the answer the disjoining and the joining and the exceptions and the all inclusive and is ignorant of an adjective of a preceding noun that explains the subsequent one and is unaware of the emphasized subject and the detailed one the obligatory laws and the permissions the places of the duties and rules and the meaning of the lawful and the unlawful and does not know the joined words and the words that are related to those coming before them or after them then such a man does not know the qur an nor is he among the people of the qur an based on these and other hadiths and in accordance with many qur anic verses why should not a company from every group remain behind to gain profound understanding tafaqquh in religion and to warn people when they return to them so that they may beware nine one two two a science of jurisprudence arose the requirements for a person to be considered a mujtahid one who can pronounce on matters of law and religion are many i ve listed a few major divisions below there are of course many subdivisions within these headings knowledge of arabic syntax conjugation roots semantics oratory knowledge of tafsir and principles of tafsir logic mantiq a knowledge of hadiths a knowledge of transmitters rijal knowledge of the principles of juriprudence qur an sunnah consensus reasoning the study of qur an and sunnah for purposes of law involves discussion of imperatives awamir discussion of negative imperatives nawahi discussion of generalities and particularities aam wa khas discussion of unconditional and conditional discussion of tacit meanings discussion of the abstract and the clear discussion of the abrogator and the abrogated the principles of application of the law involves principles of exemption principles of precaution principles of option principles of mastery the jurisprudent is bound to go through a very rigorous process in pronouncing judgement on a given situation it is not a matter of looking at one verse and one hadith now no one should blindly follow anyone but there is a difference between blind following and acceding to the opinion of someone who is clearly more knowledgeable and more qualified than oneself there is the famous hadith of the prophet s a in which he says the fuqaha religious scholars are the trustees of the prophet as long as they do not concern themselves with the illicit desires pleasures and wealth of this world the prophet s a was asked o messenger of god how may we know if they so concern themselves he s a replied by seeing whether they follow the ruling power if they do that fear for your religion and shun them i do not yet know enough about the imams of the four sunni madhabs to comment on how this hadith applies to them or to the contemporary scholars who base themselves upon them the prophet also refered to the fuqaha as the fortress of islam my only point is to make it clear that arriving at a legal judgement calls into play a certain amount of expertise the specifics of this expertise is delineated in the qur an and hadith those who acquire this expertise are praised in both the qur an and hadith those who without the requisite knowledge pronounce on matters that affect society state and religion are cautioned the only reason i said anything at all about the rushdie affair in this group is because the whole basis for the discussion of the fatwa that is apostasy was wrong when one discusses something they should at least base their discussion on fact secondly khomeini was condemned as a heretic because he supposedly claimed to be infallible another instance of creating a straw man and then beating him perhaps we should take our discussion to soc religion islam please email me rashid if you think we should do this i agree that we should move the discussion to another newsgroup unfortunately i do not have any access to email so private discussion or a moderated group is out of the question i cannot post to a moderated group like soc religion islam how about soc

two s six five eight ap mchp sni de in article i three one five zero one zero one dbstu one rz tu bs de benedikt rosenau writes in article frank d zero one two s six five eight uucp frank o dwyer writes theism is strongly correlated with irrational belief in absolutes irrational belief in absolutes is strongly correlated with fanatism deletion theism is correlated with fanaticism i have neither said that all fanatism is caused by theism nor that all theism leads to fanatism the point is theism increases the chance of becoming a fanatic one could of course argue that would be fanatics tend towards theism for example but i just have to loook at the times in history when theism was the dominant ideology to invalidate that conclusion that that is the basic mechanism behind it imo the influence of stalin or for that matter ayn rand invalidates your assumption that theism is the factor to be considered bogus i just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism the point is that theism is a factor that s your claim now back it up i consider your argument as useful as the following belief is strongly correlated with fanaticism therefore belief is a factor in fanaticism true and utterly useless note this is any belief not belief in gods tiring to say the least i have backed it up read the first statement i have read it conspicuous by its absence is any evidence or point the latter is the fallacy of the wrong analogy saying someone believes something is hardly an information about the person at all saying someone is a theist holds much more information further the correlation between theists and fanatism is higher than that between belief at all and fanatism because of the special features of theistic belief truth by blatant assertion evidence gullibility blind obedience to authority lack of scepticism and so on are all more reliable indicators and the really dangerous people the sources of fanaticism are often none of these things they are cynical manipulators of the gullible who know precisely what they are doing that s a claim you have to support please note that especially in the field of theism the leaders believe what they say if you believe that you re incredibly naive you frank o dwyer are living in a dream world i wonder if there is any base of discussion left after such a statement as a matter of fact i think you are ignorant of human nature even when one starts with something one does not believe one gets easily fooled into actually believing what one says to give you the benefit of the doubt prove your statement the onus of proof is on you sunshine what makes you think that theist leaders believe what they say especially when they say one thing and do another or say one thing closely followed by its opposite the practice is not restricted to theism but it s there for anyone to see it s almost an epidemic in this country just for instance if it is harder for a camel to pass thru the eye of a needle why is the catholic church such a wealthy land owner why are there churches to the square inch in my country now some brands of theism and more precisely some theists do tend to fanaticism i grant you to tar all theists with this brush is bigotry not a reasoned argument and it reads to me like a warm up for censorship and restriction of religious freedom ever read animal farm that s a straw man and as usually in discussions with you one has to repeat it read what i have written above not every theism leads to fanatism and not all fanatism is caused by theism the point is there is a correlation and it comes from innate features of theism no some of it comes from features which some theism has in common with some fanaticism your last statement simply isn t implied by what you say before because you re trying to sneak in innate features of all theism the word you re groping for is some bogus again not all theism as is is fanatic however the rest already gives backup for the statement about the correlation about fanatism and theism and further the specialty of other theistic beliefs allows them to switch to fanatism easily it takes just a nifty improvement in the theology truth by blatant assertion gullibility by the way is one of them no shit sherlock so why not talk about gullibility instead of theism since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have as opposed to the case you are trying to make because there is more about theism that the attraction to gullible people causing the correlation and the whole discussion started that way by the statement that theism is meaningfully correlated to fanatism which you challenged indeed i did as i recall i asked for evidence what is the correlation of which you speak and to say that i am going to forbid religion is another of your straw men interesting that you have nothing better to offer i said it reads like a warm up to that that s because it s an irrational and bogus tirade and has no other use than creating a nice them us split in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either side of church walls blah blah blah i am quite well aware that giving everyone their rights protects me better from fanatics than the other way round of course other people are always fanatics never oneself your wish to slur all theists seems pretty fanatical to me it is quite nice to see that you are actually implying a connection between that argument and the rise of fanatism so far it is just another of your assertions so you can do it two define irrational belief e g is it rational to believe that reason is always useful irrational belief is belief that is not based upon reason the latter has been discussed for a long time with charley wingate one point is that the beliefs violate reason often and another that a process that does not lend itself to rational analysis does not contain reliable information well there is a glaring paradox here an argument that reason is useful based on reason would be circular and argument not based on reason would be irrational which is it that s bogus self reference is not circular and since the evaluation of usefulness is possible within rational systems it is allowed o k it s oval it s still begging the question however and though that certainly is allowed it s not rational and you claiming to be rational and all another of your assertions no proof no evidence just claims hey i learned it from you did i do good at the risk of repeating myself and hearing we had that before we didn t hear a refutation before so we re back deal with it you can t use reason to demonstrate that reason is useful someone who thinks reason is crap won t buy it you see that is unusually weak even for you the latter implies that my proof depends on their opinion somehow who does not accept that there are triangles won t accept pythagoras wow that s an incredible insight i don t have to prove them wrong in their opinion it is possible to show that their systems leave out useful information respectively claims unreliable or even absurd statements to be information totally circular and totally useless their wish to believe makes them believe things are judges by their appeal and not by their information it makes you feel good when you believe that may be good for them but it contains zillions of possible pitfalls from belief despite contrary evidence to the bogus proofs they attempt truth by blatant assertion i ve seen as many bogus proofs of the non existence of gods as i have of their existence rational systems by the way does not mean that every data has to come from logical analysis the point is that the evaluation of the data does not contradict logic it easily follows that such a system does not allows to evaluate if its rational in itself yes it is possible to evaluate that it is rational in a system that is not rational by the fallacies of that system but since the validity of the axioms is agreed upon that has as little impact as the possibility of a demon ala descartes this just doesn t parse sorry so far it just a matter of consistency i use ratiional arguments to show that my system is consistent or that theirs isn t the evaluation of the nor this predictions does not need rationality it does not contradict however your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics and mathematics are therfore circular anybody else think godel was silly stream of consciousness typing what is that supposed to mean the first part of the second statement contains no information because you don t say what the beliefs are if the beliefs are strong theism and or strong atheism then your statement is not in general true the second part of your sentence is patently false counterexample an axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis but is assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is used to obtain it i ve been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions of god here an axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis what you say here is a an often refuted fallacy have a look at the discussion of the axiom of choice and further one can evaluate axioms in larger systems out of which they are usually derived i exist is derived if you want it that way further one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms what is it you are trying to say that at some point people always wind up saying this datum is reliable for no particular reason at all example i am not dreaming nope there is evidence for it the trick is that the choice of an axiomatic basis of a system is difficult because the possibilities are interwoven one therefore chooses that with the least assumptions or with assumptions that are necessary to get information out of the system anyway i d like to see this alleged evidence one does not need to define axioms in order to define an evaluation method for usefulness the foundation is laid by how one feels at all that s not how one feels about it i see you have no irrational beliefs but then fanatics never do do they compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational i can t agree with this until you are specific which theism to say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which i suspect you do not have using the traditonal definition of gods personal supernatural entities with objective effects on this world usually connected to morals and or the way the world works imo any belief about such gods is necessarily irrational that does not mean that people who hold them are in principle opposed to the exercise of intelligence some atheists are also scientists for example they don t use theism when doing science or it wouldn t be science please note that subjective data lend themselves to a scientific treatment as well they just prohibit formulating them as objective statements ergo nothing is objective fair enough the affinity to fanatism is easily seen it has to be true because i believe it is nothing more than a work hypothesis however the beliefs say they are more than a work hypothesis i don t understand this can you formalise your argument person a believes system b becuase it sounds so nice that does not make b true it is at best a work hypothesis however the content of b is that it is true and that it is more than a work hypothesis testing or evaluating evidence for or against it therefore dismissed because b already believed says it is wrong a waste of time not possible depending on the further contents of b amalekites idolaters protestants are to be killed this can have interesting effects peculiar definition of interesting but sure now show that a belief in gods entails the further contents of which you speak why aren t my catholic neighbours out killing the protestants for example maybe they don t believe in it maybe it s the conjunction of b asserts b and jail kill dissenters that is important and the belief in gods is entirely irrelevant it certainly seems so to me but then i have no axe to grind here the example with your neighbours is a fallacy that your neighbours don t says little about others and there were times when exactly that happened nope it s not a fallacy it just doesn t go to the correlation you wish to see and tell me when it is not irrelevant why are such statements about amalekites and idolaters in the holy books please note that one could edit them out when they are not relevant anymore because gods don t err what does that say about that message excuse me the holy books and how come we had theists saying genocides ordered by god are ok a god is the easiest way to excuse anything and therefore highly attracting to fanatics not to mention the effect interpretation by these fanatics can have on the rest of the believers happens again and again and again a god is neither the easiest way to excuse anything nor the only way frank o dwyer i m not hatching that odwyer sse ie from hens by evelyn conlon

axa one two slip dialin cwru edu summary how to get slip going on your pc keywords slip phone cslipper winqvt net i have been posting monthly how to setup a slip client on a pc posts for a few months lots of work and imminent graduation have come in the way of posting one of these for march or earlier this month for which i apologize this file includes information on writing a script for university of minnesota phone and also a batch file hack that lets you use other packet drivers with phone for additions modifications and corrections i can be reached at best wishes ashok begin slip txt based on my experiences on setting up slip under dos and windows here are my comments on setting up slip in this environment i thank the trumpet beta testers and the cwru slip beta testers for their comments configuring your modem a turn off dtr at d zero w i have to disable dtr because the communication program that i use to dial my slip server qmodem drops dtr when i exit the program and therefore hangs up the line if you use a program like kermit or conex to establish the slip connection then this need not be done these programs do not necessarily hangup the line when you exit note if you use univ of minn phone to dial and establish a slip connection you do not need to turn off dtr b dial and establish the slip connection first this can be done automatically if you use a program like phone from the university of minnesota which will dial and establish a slip connection then load the slip packet driver the phone scripting language is simple and phone scripts can be easily written to configure phone to work with other slip server in addition while the only packet driver that phone works with is umslip currently it is easy to write a batch file hack that lets phone work with other packet drivers there is a section on phone in the document with both script and batch file examples configuring the slip drivers there are five slip packet drivers commonly available cslipper exe peter tattam s compressed slip driver slipper exe peter tattam s slip driver slip eight two five zero com crynwr driver i like phil burn s modified driver ethersl com crynwr driver ethernet simulation over slip umslip com univ of minnesota driver based on slip eight two five zero of these four i vastly prefer c slipper exe over slip eight two five zero com or ethersl com for the following reasons a it is much faster even though my modem has just a one six four five zero uart b while using etherslip slip eight two five zero umslip myself and several others have noticed that the pc clock gets messed up after performing a long ftp transfer c it supports pktmux when used in ethernet simulation mode d when used in ethernet simulation mode c slipper seem to work with every tcp ip application that i have tested it with instructions for c slipper exe and you do not use phone a load slipper in your autoexec bat file according to instructions for instance if you have a v three two bis modem on com one slipper com one vec six two baud five seven six zero zero b if you use dos tcp ip applications in win three one dos boxes then use the double ended packet driver shim winpkt com this creates a virtual packet driver at zero x six zero dos applications in native mode dos applications in windows three one dos boxes and windows applications can all use this virtual driver at zero x six zero winpkt com zero x six zero zero x six two c if you use qvt net load pktint com next qvt net is configured in qvtnet ini to use the interrupt at zero x six zero pktint com instructions for slip eight two five zero com a try getting a version one zero slip driver philip burns of northwestern university has a modified slip eight two five zero com driver that is better at hardware handshaking this driver is distributed along with nupop b load the driver after establishing the slip connection my modem is a v three two bis modem on com one so here is how i would load the driver slip eight two five zero w zero x six two h four slip zero x zero three f eight five seven six zero zero c as discussed above if you use dos tcp ip applications in windows three x dos boxes you probably want to use winpkt com winpkt com zero x six zero zero x six two d if you use winqvt net load pktint com pktint com instructions for ethersl com if you choose to use ethersl com instead of slip eight two five zero com the instructions are exactly the same with one crucial difference you will have to delete the line device vcd from the three eight six enh section of system ini this will interfere with running regular windows comm applications such as crosstalk and you will get lots of dropped characters etc in these applications this is therefore not recommended etherslip would be loaded as ethersl w zero x six two h four zero x zero three f eight five seven six zero zero configuring windows three one a make the following modifications to the system ini file three eight six enh section i list all your com ports with their addresses and interrupts com one base zero three f eight com one irq four com two base zero two f eight com two irq three com three base zero three e eight com three irq five this can also be done from within windows control panel but double clicking on the ports icon ii give the port to which your modem is attached a generous com buffer com one buffer one zero zero zero zero iii change the com port autoassign value for the com port that you wish to use for your modem to zero this is the amount of time that windows waits in seconds before handing control of that com port to another application if you use winqvt net and then want to switch from one session to another and this value is at the default value of two seconds you are will get a gpf and windows will crash com one autoassign zero this can also be done from within windows control panel double click on three eight six enhanced and under device contention set the device contention for the com port your modem is on to never warn additional notes what to do if you are assigned a different ip address for each slip session i am fortunate in that our campus slip server assigns each user a permanent ip address so i do not have worry about editing qvtnet ini each time that i establish a slip connection if you are assigned a new ip address on every occasion that you dial in please try to use bootp aware software and let bootp do the configuration for you however qvtnet is not bootp aware and rarp will not work over a slip connection to get qvtnet working in a situation such as this you must do the following edit the qvtnet ini file let the net section look like this net name ip netmask two five five two five five two five five zero or whatever is appropriate for you arptime two zero packet vector six zero or whatever is appropriate save the changes and then write protect this file attrib r qvtnet ini start your slip connection and remember the name and ip address that you are assigned each time you start qvt net three one x the general configuration dialog box will open enter the name and ip address and you were assigned for that session click on ok and you should be up and running the changes you make will not be saved as qvtnet ini is write protected a more elegant solution to the problem of dynamic slip ip address assignment is provided by victor menayang victor ccwf cc utexas edu victor uses the program bootpq to semi automate qvtnet preparation bootpq is used to inquire the assigned ip which is then saved to a file called myip another file noip is essentially a complete qvtnet ini file that lacks the ip address in the final step myip and noip are copied into a single qvtnet ini file an example of victor s batch file is provided below slipper com two pktint com bootpq i ip s myip bootpq i my ip is s copy q net myip noip e com qvtnet qvtnet ini del q myip echo off echo echo ready to run winqvtnet for questions and more details about bootpq please contact victor menayang victor ccwf cc utexas edu qpc software is attempting to add bootp capability to winqvt net how do you use pktmux over slip pktmux will not work over the slip eight two five zero com packet driver and crashes immediately if used with ethersl com pktmux will work with c slipper exe when c slipper is used in ethernet simulation mode an example of this configuration is shown below the latest release of pktmux is one two c and it is important that you use this version if you want to use virtual packet drivers with applications like trumpet for windows to be released very shortly from autoexec bat lh c slipper com one vec six five baud five seven six zero zero ether packet driver lh pktmux five six five five pktmux loaded for five virtual packet drivers lh pktdrv seven f six five first virtual packet driver used for qvt net lh pktint com qvt net pktint com pktdrv six three six five pktdrv for use in native dos or wintrumpet additional virtual packet drivers can be loaded directly from within windows three one dos boxes for example my pif file to load popmail is directed to the file popmail bat this is what popmail bat reads like pktdrv six zero six five loads a virtual packet driver at zero x six zero cd popmail popmail cd pktdrv six zero u unloads the packet driver at zero x six zero exit causes the dos window to close i have similar batch files that load other dos tcp ip applications like pc gopher it is my experience that pktmux works fine even if the virtual packet drivers in two independent virtual dos sessions are loaded at the same software interrupt for example within two different dos boxes one for popmail and the other for gopher the virtual packet driver pktdrv is loaded at zero x six zero in each instance how much does pktmux degrade the performance of c slipper i have a v three two bis v four two bis modem in a three eight six three three running windows three one with a reasonably fast video card ati graphics ultra under these conditions when i have three virtual packet drivers loaded and being used as follows a driver at zero x seven f qvtnet ftp client session b driver at zero x six zero in one dos window cutcp tn three two seven zero session c driver at zero x six zero in another dos window trumpet for dos i get ftp transfer rates of zero eight one zero kb sec while transferring compressed files this rate is comparable to that which i get with slip eight two five zero loaded as a packet driver and where a single tcp ip session is active if cslipper is used a packet driver and a single session is active i get transfer rates of one three one four kb sec on the same files while there is about four zero degradation in the performance of slipper for me the benefits of being able to use pktmux outweigh the performance hit c slipper and ethernet simulation mode in ethernet simulation mode c slipper ver one three works with all the applications that i have tested it with one or two applications that required ethernet simulation balked at c slipper one two but even these rare problems have been resolved with ver one three when slipper is used in ethernet simulation mode and used with pktmux i get some an error message in the qvtnet console window that reads ip incorrect packet type or ip bad version number this does not seem to prevent qvtnet from functioning although i cannot comment on loss of performance what can you do if your dos tcp ip application does not work with c slipper in ethernet simulation mode in the rare event that you find a package that does not work with c slipper in ethernet simulation mode first contact the author peter tattam peter psychnet psychol utas edu au and let him know chances are that he can fix it in the meanwhile you can try the following i do not know if it is kosher but it worked when i had problems with c slipper ver one two c slipper is loaded at zero x six two as described above under the pktmux section i load ethersl com at zero x six zero run the application and then terminate ethersl com this also works within windows three one virtual dos boxes however a packet driver like ethersl can be used in only one virtual dos box at a time so for example here is my batch file to run grateful med a medical reference retrieval program developed at the national library of medicine ethersl w zero x six zero h four zero x zero three f eight five seven six zero zero loads etherslip cd gm six search cd termin zero x six zero terminates etherslip exit closes the dos box and returns me to windows if you use this method be cautious about one thing don t have any active pktmux dos sessions open at the same time after closing the ethersl window you can run your pktmux dos sessions with no problem btw the example above grateful med works with no problems with c slipper ver one three phone script files the documentation that accompany phone provide good instructions on writing script files to get phone to dial slip servers other than the university of minnesota server for example here is a script that i use to dial a cisco server at the university that i attend background to start a slip connection

various alternatives please send updates corrections suggestions and revisions to me please thank me for writing this on my own time by keeping my name with the document thank you for your respect this document copyright one nine nine one by thomas b kinsman if desired a postscript version of this document is available this information is free you get more than what you pay for don t sue me if i m wrong overview the dib image file format is intended to be a device independent bitmap file format what microsoft means by device independent is unclear to me four pixel resolutions are supported one bit four bit eight bit and two four bit pixels these images were intended for use on dos ibm or little endian systems if you are creating them on another architecture you will have to byte swap all short and long integer values by convention dib images end in the extension bmp this is because march one five one nine nine one two they are a super set of earlier bitmap image files consequently you will sometimes hear dib files referred to as bmp files since dib images files are a super set there are three flavors of dib images o dos dib images these are the recommended convention and the form which i will describe how to create they are intended for applications running under ms windows three zero in a dos environment o os two dib images my understanding is that these are the flavor of dib images that were used by the presentation manager o old style bitmap images march one five one nine nine one three differences between flavors the dos dib images consist of one a bitmapfileheader file header which identifies the file as a dib file this header also gives the total size of the image file and the offset to the image data two a bitmapinfoheader image header which specifies the image attributes three an optional palette of colors used by the image if it exists this may contain two one six or two five six entries each entry is a windows rgbquad structure four the image data itself the os two dib images consist of one the same bitmapfileheader file header which identifies the file as a dib file this header also gives the total size of the image file and the offset to the image data two a bitmapcoreheader image header which specifies the image attributes three an optional palette of colors used by the image again if this exists it may contain two one six or two five six entries each entry is a windows rgbtriple structure four the image data itself the old style image bitmap consists of one either a bitmapinfoheader or a bitmapcoreheader which header type is determined by the first long integer dword value two an optional color palette this palette may be composed of either windows rgbquad structures if the header was a bitmapinfoheader or windows rgbtriple structures if the header was a bitmapcoreheader three the image data itself creating dib image files creating a dos dib image file consists of several straight forward steps the headers need to be created and then written to the file these header structures are defined in the ms windows three zero windows h include file palette information needs to be stored for images that are not two four bit images the five general steps are one filling in the bitmapfileheader and the bitmapinfoheader structures the basic image information two if the image is a one bit four bit or an eight bit image creating the color palette of rgbquads three calculating the total file size and putting this information in march one five one nine nine one four the bfsize field of the bitmapfileheader four calculating the offset to the image data from the start of the file and putting this in the bfoffbits field of the bitmapfileheader five writing to the file the bitmapfileheader the bitmapinfoheader the color palette and the image data in that order the following sections describe structures in terms of microsoft c type defined keywords the following table describes these keywords for those not familiar with microsoft c type defined keywords in microsoft c typedef meaning byte unsigned character word two byte unsigned integer dword four byte unsigned integer march one five one nine nine one five the bitmapfileheader this structure is defined in windows h as typedef struct tagbitmapfileheader bitmapfileheader the bftype field is the two ascii characters b and m this serves to identify the file as a dib image file on an intel byte ordered machine ibm or a compatible this constant can be formed in c as the quantity m eight b zero x four d four two on an intel system the bfsize field is the total size of the file for our purposes this field is equal to the size of the bitmapfileheader plus the size of the bitmapinfoheader plus the number of entries in the color palette times the size of a rgbquad plus the number of bytes of image data if the image data is being written out in an uncompressed form this value can be calculated ahead of time otherwise this field needs to be filled in later both the bfreserved one and the bfreserved two fields are always set to zero the bfoffbits field is set to the offset to the start of the image data from the start of the file for our purposes this field should be set to the size of the bitmapfileheader plus the size of the bitmapinfoheader plus the number of entries in the color palette times the size of a rgbquad this works out because the image data is written write after the color palette if one exists march one five one nine nine one six the bitmapinfoheader this structure is defined in windows h as typedef struct tagbitmapinfoheader bitmapinfoheader the bisize field is set to the size of the bitmapinfoheader structure itself when reading the image file this value is what is used to determine that the image contains a bitmapinfoheader and not a bitmapcoreheader the biwidth field is the width of the image in image pixels the biheight field is the height of the image in image lines the biplanes field should always be set to one this data is written out as if there was one color plane the bibitcount field is the bit depth of the image this must be either one four eight or two four depending on the bit depth of the image data the bicompression field tells how the image data is compressed if it is compressed dib images support two forms of run length encoding however i have never seen any images which use it and don t know yet how it works set this field to zero long zero or zero l to indicate that the data is not compressed all subsequent fields of the bitmapinfoheader structure may be set to zero a requirement of the interpretting software that it be able to compute these fields as necessary from the previous information the field which you might want to explicitly specify might be biclrused for four bit and eight bit images this field indicates that not all of the possible color entries are used and that the image contains biclrused colors if you are using only three two colors with an eight bit image then you may only want to save three two of the possible two five six palette entries generally set this field to zero march one five one nine nine one seven color palettes each entry of a color palette is a rgbquad structure the rgbquad structure is defined in the windows h include file as typedef struct tagrgbquad rgbquad the rgbreserved field is always zero for each color used the amount of blue green and red are filled into the structure and the structure is written to the file a value of zero in the rgbblue rgbgreen or rgbred fields indicates that that particular component does not contribute to the color composition a value of two five five in any of these fields indicates that the component contributes fully to the color composition image data there are three surprises about the ordering of image data in dib image file the creator of this format was determined to be creative and certainly was within the image data each line written out is padded to the next four byte quantity so if you had an eight bit image which was only one pixel wide you still have to write out four bytes for every image line the number of bytes per line can be calculated as bytes per line width in pix bit depth three one three two four or in terms of the fields of the bitmapinfoheader structure bytes per line biwidth bibitcount three one three two four when writing out your image data you must write it out bottom line first the bottom line of the image as you would look at it on the screen is the first line of image data in the file for one bit four bit and eight bit images information is written as you would expect one bit images are padded eight pixels to a byte four bit images are padded two pixels to a byte eight bit images are written one pixel per byte twenty four bit images are written three bytes per pixel however for two four bit images the information must be written out in the order blue green red while most image file formats write data out in march one five one nine nine one eight an rgb ordering a dib image file writes the data out in an bgr ordering summary this should provide enough information to create dib images from applications such as scanners or for image exporting routines if you find out any more about dib images please pass the information on to me so that i can modify this document accordingly march one

 from kayman xenon stanford edu robert kayman subject summary canon bj two zero zero vs hp deskjet five zero zero organization computer science department stanford university lines four zero one hello again about a week and one half ago i posted a query looking for people feelings on the inkjet family of printers specifically a comparison between the canon bj two zero zero bubblejet and the hewlett packard deskjet five zero zero many people asked me to post the summary account of all the postings and e mail i received below is my original query and the responses i received i have not deleted any part of the responses only the headers and signatures so you can extract what you find necessary some people asked me for an unbiased account however the very nature of the question suggests favoritism and biased comments you must extract the information you believe unbiased and a fair representation of each printer there are a wide range of comments each has its own value there was no clear winner some like the bj two zero zero especially its price performance ratio others preferred the durability and reliability of the deskjet the original inkjet with proven drivers and a solid background two new inkjet printers have drawn some attention a new printer to be introduced by hewlett packard later this year around summertime and an addition to the epson product line their first inkjet you will find that after the initial purchase the costs of re filling or replacing the ink cartridges are about the same this largely depends on where you purchase the re fills or replacements so shop around first since this aspect will most likely dominate the cost of your printer no one mentioned approx how many sheets each ink cartridge will print but i suspect they are roughly equal at about one zero zero zero one five zero zero sheets laser printers will do four zero zero zero five zero zero zero sheets per toner cartridge well that s a brief research summary of my personal research enjoy hello fellow netters i am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer i should purchase the canon bj two zero zero bubblejet vs the hp deskjet five zero zero i thought rather than trust the salesperson i would benefit more from relying on those who use these printers daily and use them to their fullest potential and i figure all of you will know their benefits and pitfalls better than any salesperson now i would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the three six zero dpi of the canon bubblejet vs the hewlett packard deskjet five zero zero three zero zero dpi which is faster is there a noticeable print quality difference particularly in graphics which will handle large documents better seven five pages or more any personal experience on either will be appreciated here which works better under windows three one any driver problems etc cost of memory font packages toner cartridges etc basically your personal experiences with either of these machines is highly desirable both good and bad well i bought the bj two zero zero about a month ago at the start of their five zero rebate program on that printer it ends five three one and i bought it from computer discount warehouse because their price of three two five couldn t be beat anywhere i looked and i think it s a hot printer just using regular copier paper produced fantastic results just in high quality mode i compared the output of a micrografx designer legal size drawing with four pt type done on my bj two zero zero with the same drawing printed on an hp laserjet iid and i was amazed how well i could read the small print on the bj two zero zero printing speed was several seconds faster on the bj two zero zero which is amazing considering that the hp has two five m ram installed i measured the time from when the printer first indicated it was receiving data as i used print manager in windows i showed the output to several people at work and one manager bought one immediately for his office and two other engineers placed their orders too if you need cdw s phone number it s eight zero zero five nine eight four two three nine delivery to ny was two days good luck craig witkowski ceng five one maccvm corp mot com motorola communications electronics inc glen rock nj i own a deskjet five zero zero performance isn t spectacular under windows using truetype fonts but neither is the canon from what i have seen quality for the hp is very much dependent on paper quality on standard photo copy paper the characters have slightly frayed edges but on better quality distinction type paper things look better for most applications i find copy paper fine still better than dot matrix comes with a windows driver which seems to by pass print manager has a few intelli fonts which are hp scaleable fonts probably faster than truetype but haven t really tried them out can get ram font cartridges but unless the speed of truetype is a problem i wouldn t bother the ram cartridges can t be used as buffer soft fonts only for graphics i e bmp images etc the hp can be put into a dither mode via the hp supplied win driver there a number of dither options such as scatter pattern etc the manual gives recommendations depending on the type of image being printed text is not so good in this mode problem arises when you have a document which contains both graphic and text the range of tones for graphic images isn t brilliant but i think that is more of a limitation with inkjet printers in general from what i have seen the canon is similar in most respects however a printer definitely worth looking at is the new inkjet from epson this printer is faster cheaper and capable of producing laser like quality on normal copier paper can t remember the model lx something i think i purchased my hp days before the epson was released here the introductory price on the epson was the same as the hp here in new zealand about a month ago i got a canon bj two zero zero i absolutely love it it is incredibly fast except for printing from pspice i don t know if you ever do stuff with that or not most of the stuff i print is either from microsoft word for windows or just plain text the only problems i ve had are printing headers footers the printer freaked out and printing on cheap paper lots of streaks normal copy paper works great with it you can only tell it s not laser printed by holding it oh less than twelve inches from your face that is if you re nearsighted like me the printer comes with its own driver for windows three one i have no other complaints the printer also can act just like some epson or another for those archaic software packages that haven t written a driver for it yet the teeny weeny footprint is a real plus too and if you purchase it between now and may three one you get a five zero rebate from canon i bought mine from a store called compusa and the price now is three four zero i have a friend who has the hp you are looking at it also prints very well and everyone has drivers for it but it is very slow hope i helped three six zero dpi sure looks great heather stehman in article ceng five one

as i used print manager in windows i guess i have some experience with both i have a bj three zero zero at work and a deskjet five zero zero at home i prefer the deskjet the printing speed and quality are similar i tested both with text and graphics before buying the deskjet for home the feature that sets the deskjet apart is the driver support in so many applications the bj ends up emulating the epson lq or ibm proprinter to get it to work with many non windows apps and this will be the case for a long time the design is superior if you just want to use cut paper the deskjet is quieter and the ink cartridges are quite a bit cheaper due to the number of deskjets out there in comparision to the bjs just my zero zero two worth mike mattix agricultural group of monsanto p o box one seven four luling la seven zero zero seven zero internet address dmmatt bigez monsanto com yes there is the landscape mode printing problem but it does not present a problem in windows as the windows printer driver handles the translation i actually thought of some other points after i posted the note the deskjet has an unprintable area of approximately five inch around the paper the bubblejet does not you are right about the graphics resolutions i tested the printers with the applications i had access to wordperfect harvard graphics wingif paintshop pro and paintbrush and could not tell a difference in fact one of the hp deskjet windows drivers gives you significant control over the contrast and density of the printer hence controlling the amount of ink you put down the bubblejet did not i had no imaging software to test the printers with and so had no comparision there finally i wanted sheet feeding in that configuration the bubblejet cost approximately one zero zero more than the deskjet i went through a pretty thorough evaluation and chose the deskjet when i spent my own money btw i am replacing the bj three zero zero with a deskjet five zero zero at work this month anyway regards mike mattix ag group of monsanto luling la i spent some time comparing the two we ended up getting the bubblejet bj two zero zero versus the hp our reasons were one the hp seemed to have worse banding than the canon two three six zero dpi versus three zero zero we felt we could see the difference three price canon has a five zero rebate program going on at the moment the bj two zero zero was our choice over the bj one zero ex we could have one zero zero pages in the bj two zero zero feeder the bj one zero ex holds only three zero pages i think as you can see up to one zero zero pages on the bj two zero zero we haven t done anything big with the bj but its performance seems reasonable under windows i know that the microsoft bbs has a newer windows driver than comes with the printer but i don t know how it compares also the driver included with the printer is canon s whereas i don t know where the microsoft bbs one comes from microsoft hope this helps thomas v frauenhofer wa two yyw tvf cci com uunet uupsi cci six three two tvf tvf cs rit edu mandlebratwurst the meal that eats itself altough i m sometimes also a salesperson if i m not suppost to study i would recommend to buy the bj two zero zero the printing quality is a bit better but you you ve got much more possiblities don t forget the hp engine is at least two years on the marked the canon engine witch is also used in other new bubblejet printers like e g the epson ones is quite recently available now i would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the three six zero dpi of the canon bubblejet vs the hewlett packard deskjet five zero zero three zero zero dpi which is faster is there a noticeable print quality difference particularly in graphics which will handle large documents better seven five i ve seen during a short demonstration from someone who tryed to sell me canon printers two times the same picture one printed with the bj two zero zero one with the canon the other with the hp and there was a difference in printing quality the canon was a bit better greetz kris when we decided we needed quiet printers in our hospital we looked to inkjet printers they have near laser quality speed and they are quiet we use both hp deskjets and the canon bj two zero zero s i prefer the paper handling qualities of the deskjets but i feel the canons have superior print quality the ideal would be a canon with a sheet feeder however i did end up buying a deskjet for home use got too good a deal anyway we are using canons in high volume areas and they are holding up very well out of one five deskjets and four bj two zero zero s i have only had one problem with a deskjet and that was taken care of very quickly by hp nate whenever i buy anything i look at what the experts say pick out the top few and then buy on whatever criteria are the most apt i ve been unusually flush lately no begging letter please and so i ve done this a few times including about four months ago with inkjet printers i can t remember much about the process except that i read about three reviews of inkjets and that the five zero zero was always at or near the top i bought the five zero zero c because of the added dimension of colour i intend to build a multi media machine at some stage and have just bought a colour scanner towards that although i haven s used the colour thing in earnest yet i tried it out on a couple of windows bitmaps and i was pleased with the result i note that even though you can now get the five five zero c the one with both colour and mono with no need to change the cartridge the five zero zero c and five zero zero are still readily available at least in the uk the following are my views experience one i don t know anything about the canon except that i came away from reviews and replies to a posting similar to yours with the idea that the hp offered the best performance price ratio two i believe hp are the originals in the field not always the ideal place to be but the market s still young so one assumes they have the expertise three the five zero zero c is worth the extra operation in mono is perfectly acceptable and i get good crisp reproduction of fonts from windows four i used to work for monotype when they still manufactured typesetters before their american owners closed them down and i can tell you that in terms of definition three zero zero dpi is pretty poor anyway so three six zero dpi is just a bit less poor five the hp comes with a reasonable set of drivers six if you buy it invest in the additional ram pack it s pretty slow with it god knows what it s like without i actually work in germany and my pc is home in the uk so it s not in daily use i would say that apart from my not reading the manual properly and having a really dumb problem at the start it s easy peasy to operate hope this is of use regards david just bought the bj two zero zero i thought the price couldn t be beat three two nine with five zero rebate thru five three one and so far it is comparable even superior to the deskjet in print quality speed per page rate seems to be faster i don t have figures i don t print long docs though quality i think the graphics quality is excellent print quality is excellent as well unless you use small fonts and hold it up close you can see a lot more jaggies than on a laserjet the three six zero dpi is offset by a little less accuracy in holding the page print head in place i would imagine large docs not room in the standard model for a whole lotta pages manual says up to one zero zero though haven t tried it drivers no problems under win three one yet winword doesn t want to print the envelopes the same way the canon does though know nothing of add on costs daniel a hartung dhartung chinet chinet com ask me about rotaract the deskjet is slow this is in comparison to the other printers i mentioned i have no idea how the bubblejet compares the interface between win three one and the printer is just dandy i ve not had any problems with it i just bought a bj two zero zero printer a couple of days ago i compared it to the sample print of an hp deskjet five zero zero and knew that the hp wasn t for me the bj two zero zero is pretty fast and really prints with good quality i can compare it with the hp laserjet iiid postscript and they look almost identical depending on the kind of paper i don t have problems with the ink not being dry it seems to dry very fast probably within a second since canon is giving a five zero rebate until the end of may it is really a good buy sean eckton computer support representative college of fine arts and communications wow it s funny you should ask this i m a little behind in news reading so i know this may be late i just purchased the canon bubblejet last night i was really worried that i wouldn t like it but the print quality and noise level is fantastic i printed quite a few documents with lots of graphics and it printed damn near laser quality you can t tell it s not laser unless you get two inches from the page no problems with drivers the printer came with the driver diskette which is good because i was beginning to panic when i couldn t findi it under windows or wordperfect it works well under both i have yet to install word for windows so don t know how it works with them i had a deskjet five zero zero at work last year it was a good printer as well ut i felt it was awfully slow and much noisier than the bubblejet i won t say the bubblejet is much better but i really do like it more just my

 from glazer ohstpy mps ohio state edu subject local windows vs shared windows discussion organization the ohio state university department of physics lines one one zero i would like to see a serious discussion on the best way to install windows from a novell administrator s point of view i just got off the phone with ms access support and was told that they microsoft has decided to implement as a standard for software support the local setup described below as the most advantageous installation if this is true and microsoft deems this to be the most prudent installation then i will comply but i d like to hear it from administrators first the local windows installation windows is fully installed on each workstation hard drive assuming the resources are available from a network administrator s implementation he she would install all windows disks on a network drive using setup a then install windows on a per machine bases by running setup off the network to install the complete system on the local drives in this way all drivers are available to the setup procedure w o the need to change disks advantages reduce traffic running windows locally reduces network traffic due to the local access of main windows files network independence if the network fails and they all do at one point or another the local installation would allow users to keep producing and reduce the cost of down time faster windows theoretically windows will run faster from a local hard drive than over a network this may be a hard point to prove if the network has an optical backbone and or the network drives are significantly faster access than local ones a user traveling from machine to machine does not need to worry about varying setups monochrome color types of mouse etc since the windows installation is assigned to the workstation disadvantages cost installing windows locally requires a significant amount of disk space workstations now must be purchased with a hard disk that can increase the cost of the workstation from one zero to three zero percent administration local windows installations are very difficult to administer new drivers for peripherals are constantly being made available each of which would have to be individually installed on each workstation security users now have access to erase or corrupt their own system files from simple ignorance this could result in quite a headache for administrators who may have to constantly repair damaged installations backup we all know the problems backing up local hard disks the backup sets if done via a centralized tape system get very large very quickly backup individually to floppy may not happen at all this may be eliminated if it is assumed that local hard disks only contain replaceable applications and not user data the shared windows installation windows is fully installed to a network disk via the setup a procedure described above users or administrators then install a minimal set of files to individual user directories these directories may be on a local hard disk or perhaps a network home directory the bulk of the windows system files are maintained on the network in a single directory some four zero zero files and are accessed shared as needed by users throughout their windows session the user s files consist of a small set of files that the user has updated during his her windows session these include group files ini files and other regularly updated files advantages a single location for all files makes updates to drives easy as an updated driver becomes available it only needs to be installed in this single directory for all users to be able to take advantage of it assuming that the users files are maintained in network home directories the administrator can easily edit any ini file as needed to correct problems that may arise this includes win ini and system ini backup of all pertinent files is done easily even if the users files are on a local hard disk the bulk of the windows system is backed up with all driver updates disadvantages network traffic since all windows files are being shared in a network directory traffic on the network can become a problem an effect the speed of windows if the network crashes all production comes to a stop since window s is reliant upon the network for its files loss of data usually occurs as well since users working in windows at the time of the crash will usually not be able to save their work although minimal disk space is still a consideration if the users files are maintained on the network a large number of users can cause a significant utilization of disk space due to their personal windows files alone users cannot easily move from machine to machine unless the workstation hardware are similar this is due to the windows installation being tied to a particular username in the case of network user files the discussion i would like to know from other administrators with a large windows userbase how they prefer setting up windows personally i have setup numerous installations using the shared setup all windows and application files are on the network with little or no utilization of local hard disks in fact i sold a network on the fact that the company would no longer need to purchase hard disks for their workstations and thus save that much more money i would also like to see recommendations for applications should apps such as word and or excel be installed locally regardless of how windows is installed again i keep all files on the network for easy backup and administration but this is putting all eggs in one basket if the network crashes work comes to a halt now i am sure microsoft and i know your out there has their own ideas about this and their insights would be of great value but i hope to hear from people with actual working experience with users and network administration

bferrell ant occ uc edu brett ferrell writes in article ludes hubcap clemson edu larry ludes ludwig writes munch you must of read too many os two advertisements crash protection is such a marketing gimick it isn t funny out of four months of using windows on my new machine i ve only had it crash once and i don t have a run of the mill configuration munch following is reformatted it does sound funny i will admit but for me it is true windows crashed on all of the time and from what i have read in pc mag this is not the exception i d say that the massive crash problems are exceedingly rare windows itself almost never crashes but it can be crashed by an errant application my personal favorite any one of the corel three zero programs on the other hand i have had os two crash randomly a number of times mostly just running it s own applications for instance today i discovered a new one while i was downloading with procomm plus for windows running seamless with the standard vga drivers on a run o da mill vga card six four zero x four eight zero i decided that i wanted to edit a copy of a quote that i wanted to add to my finger but since i ve learned not to really trust seamless i fired up a full screen winos two three one session whoops the download finished while winos two was loading it had just gotten the pointer up so i hit alt escape to get back t the desktop i have a lot of fonts so loading takes a good long while blam screen trashed procomm hangs up hm well i can sorta see the mouse so i clicked on the minimized winos two session and got back my fullscreen windows session but the color were off red and green and yellow and brown instead of blues and greys so i closed this and got back to the desktop now fully restored pp was still sitting window open but it was no longer connected to the com port so i exited it the normal way it told me i was still online and it would hang up though it was already hung up hm well load anothe no bad idea shutdown and reboot ok refresh first now shutdown yes everything is closed hm nothing seems to be happening let s see ah the windows list still comes up ok let s try shutdown again no go huh alright wait six zero seconds to see if it s just running slow hmm still seems to be running os two try shutdown again nothing oh well reboot enjoy the checkdisk time in this case a part of the os crashed not only itself but os two entirely which isn t even smart enough to tell when it s been compromised i guess in everyday specifically today use os two gives each windows app a vdm and they can t touch each other or generally anything they aren t supposed to have that s the idea anyway in truth when a program crashes on os two it will bring the system down with it the programs that would just gpf under windows do the same under os two but programs that are fine under dos and windows bring os two screaming to a halt task protection or no for instance i m still wondering why print preview in a windowed wp five one dos locks up my system it works fine under dos or even in a dos box under windows three one admittedly it doesn t crash if i run wp five one full screen but the first time this bug big me it bit hard if windows works for you then great maybe this is why some people don t see why os two is the os of choice if windows doesn t crash on you and you don t mind waiting on each task please explain the only time i wait on anything under windows is when i m copying or formatting a floppy or when printing and even then not long i get nine to one one pages dumped to the printman per minute and can still go do things slowly while it s doing this i ve downloaded with pp nine six zero zero while printing and not being able to adress your memory better than dos not sure what you mean here os two sees one six megs uses five or six of these for it s own use more if you want to count winos two windows sees one six megs uses three or four more like five if you count the disk cache as i am for os two for itself if memory efficiency were a big issue pc geos would be the current king of the intel desktop some of the key reasons for using os two are gone i probably would still use it but it would be more of an even fight on the other hand i am finally able to say with some confidence that both os two and windows have a bit of hardware sensitivity to them for instance the machine i am sitting at runs both fine while the machine next to me constantly locks up under windows but ran os two without a hitch once i got it through a five crash install on the whole i d say os two is a whole lot more sensitive than windows but there are i suppose machines that windows just doesn t like wittism of th week i think that it s wrong to believe in an ism you should believe in yourself ferrish

advantage of the more robust signal processing functions available in mathematica v two one since mathematica two one provides a better and working laplacetransform and inverselaplacetransform functions than mathematica v two zero did we adopted them this has made cosy pak smaller thus brian evans signal processing packages that supported the laplacetransform and inverselaplacetransform functions in the cosy pak v zero eight one are no longer needed directly by cosy pak v zero nine for power users who use signal processing we still recommend the use of the very fine brian evans package on signal processing available at the anonymous ftp site gauss eedsp gatech edu or ip one three zero two zero seven two two six two four on the downside the disadvantage of this update can be that mathematica two one requires more runtime resources than its previous version for mathematica two zero users we have included the laplacetransform package from mathematica two one in the

control systems analysis package for symbolic control systems analysis using mathematica two one classical control systems analysis and design methods and some modern control systems methods have been

no bad sectors i ll send you a copy i was dumb enough not to get his phone number so i can t return it to him the drive has many jumpers on it which i don t know how to set so maybe that s the problem

a project two zero six five meg seagate five two five hh scsi hard drive model st two seven seven n i originally bought this drive because it had a small stiction problem and i though that i could fix it well i determined that the drive mechanism was fine and that it was a controller problem motor controller wasn t sending proper signals well after taking the controller off the drive looking at it and putting it back together i realized that i accidentally severed one of the small flat cables that connect the drive to the controller i tried to solder it but i m not that good at soldering so i couldn t do it worked perfectly before i messed up i used it as a temporary drive when the sony above crashed on me also loaded the drive with about twenty mac applications worth well over one zero zero zero claris cad ms word five zero think c excel and many others i think all it needs is a resoldering of that cable you also get all the software on the drive if you can accept being a pirate i

 from kxgst one pitt edu kenneth gilbert subject re persistent vs chronic organization university of pittsburgh lines two nine in article doyle pitt edu howard r doyle writes chronic persistent hepatitis is usually diagnosed when someone does a liver biopsy on a patient that has persistently elevated serum transaminases months after a bout of acute viral hepatitis or when someone is found to have persistently elevated transaminases on routine screening tests the degree of elevation in the serum transaminases can be trivial or as much as ten times normal other blood chemistries are usually normal as a rule patients with cph have no clinical signs of liver disease chronic active hepatitis can also be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic at least initially and that s why it s important to tell them apart by means of a biopsy the patient with cph only needs to be reassured the patient with cah needs to be treated i just went back to the chapter in cecil on chronic hepatitis it seems that indeed most cases of cph are persistant viral hepatitis whereas there are a multitude of potential and probable causes for cah viral drugs alcohol autoimmune etc physicians seem to have a variety of thresholds for electing to biopsy someone s liver personally i think that if the patient is asymptomatic with only slight transaminitis and normal albumin and pt one can simply follow them closely and not add the potential risks of a biopsy others may well biopsy such a patient thus providing these samples for study it would be interesting to see if anyone s done any decision analysis on this kenneth gilbert university of pittsburgh general internal medicine dammit not a programmer

 from banschbach vms ocom okstate edu subject depression lines two two zero nntp posting host vms ocom okstate edu organization osu college of osteopathic medicine some of the md s in this newsgroup have been riding my butt pretty good maybe in some cases with good reason in this post on depression i m laying it all out i ll continue to post here because i think that i have some knowledge that could be useful once you have read this post you should know where i m coming from when i post again in the future in article lchaplyn mail sas upenn edu lida chaplynsky writes a family member of mine is suffering from a severe depression brought on by menopause as well as a mental break down she is being treated with halydol with some success but the treatments being provided through her psychiatrist are not satisfactory someone suggested contacting a nutritionist to discuss alternative treatment since she is sensitive to medication i think this is a good suggestion but don t know where to begin if anyone can suggest a philly area nutritionist or else some literature to read i d appreciate it lida i can emphasize with your situation both my wife and i suffered from bouts of depression her s was brought on by breast cancer and mine was a rebound stress reaction to her modified radical mastectomy and chemotherapy lida i used my knowledge of nutrition to get her through her six months of chemotherapy with the approval of her oncologist when severe depression set in a few months after the chemo stopped i tried to use supplements to bring her out of it i had cured her pms using supplements and i really thought that i knew enough about the role of diet in depression to take care of her depression as well it didn t work and she was put on prozac by her oncologist two winters ago three years after by wife s breast cancer i got hit with severe depression pretty typical and one reason why many marriages break up after breast cancer or another stressor i tried to take care of it for several months with supplementation didn t work my internist ended up putting me on prozac i was going to give you a list of several studies that have been done using b six niacin folate and b one two to cure depression i m not going to do that because all you would be doing is flying blind like i was lida i do believe that depression can have a dietary component but the problem is that you need to know exactly what the problem is and then use an approach which will fix the problem for chemotherapy i knew exactly what drugs were going to be used and exactly what nutrients would be affected same thing for pms i was flying blind for both of these stressors but the literature that i used to devise a treatment program was pretty good depression is just too complicated what you really need is a nutritional scan this is not a diet analysis but an analysis of your bodies nutrient reserves for every vitamin and mineral except vitamin c you have a reserve the rda is not designed to give you enough of any nutrient to keep these reserves full it is only designed to keep them from being emptied which would cause clinical pathology stress will increase your need for many vitamins and minerals this is when your reserves become very important lida without your permission i m going to use your post as a conduit to try to explain to the readers in this group and sci med where i m coming from i have taught a course on human nutrition in one of the osteopathic medical schools for ten years now i ve written my own textbook because none was available what i teach is not a rehash of biochemistry i preach nutrient reserves yes my lectures in this course are referred to by my students as sermons here is what i cover indroduction and carbohydrates lipids proteins i proteins ii energy balance evaluation of nutritional status i a clinical perspective evaluation of nutritional status ii evaluation of nutritional a biochemical perspective status iii homework assignment using the nutritionist iv diet and fitness analysis software program weight control food fads and facts age related change in nutrient requirements food additives contaminants and cancer drug nutrient interactions mineral and water balance sodium potassium and chloride calcium magnesium and phosphorus iron zinc and copper iodine and fluoride other trace minerals vitamin a vitamin e vitamins d and k vitamin c thiamin and niacin riboflavin and pyridoxine pantothenic and folic acids biotin and b one two other nutrient factors enteral nutrition parenteral nutrition every three years i spend my entire summer reviewing the medical literature to find material that i can use in my nutrition textbook i last did this in the summer of one nine nine one i read everything that i can find and then sit down and rewrite my lecture handouts which are bound in three separate books that have two one seven two three seven and one two two pages opposite each page of written text which i write myself i ve pulled figures tables and graphs from various copyrighted sources since this material is only being used for educational purposes i can get around the copyright laws so far i can not send this material out to newsgroup readers as i ve been asked to do i am now in the process of trying to get a grant to setup a nutrition assessment lab this is the last peice of the nutrition puzzle that i need to make my education program complete this lab will let me measure the nutrient reserve for almost all the vitamins and minerals that are known to be required in humans the mayo clinic already uses a similiar lab to design supplement programs for their cancer patients cancer treatment centers of america which is a private for profit organization with hospitals in illinois and oklahoma tulsa also operates a nutritional assessment clinical lab i also believe that the pritikin clinic in california has a similiar lab setup for physicians reading this post i would suggest that you get the new clinical nutrition textbook that has just been published feb by mosby i have been using alpers manual of nutritional therapeutics a little brown series book as a supplemental text for my course but alpers is geared more to residency training two m d s have written this new clinical nutrition textbook and it is geared more towards medical student education and it does a good job of covering the lab tests that can be run to assess a patient s nutritional status let me quote a few sentences from the preface of this new text so called nutrition specialists were in reality gastroenterologists hematologists or pediatricians who just happened to profess some knowledge of nutrition as it related to their field of practice unfortunately about two thirds of the medical schools in the united states require no formal instruction in nutrition but times and medical practice have changed more than half of the leading causes of death in this country are nutrition related this monograph should accomplish the following two objectives one it should complement your medical training by emphasizing the relevance of nutrition to your medical practice and two it should heighten your awareness of nutrition as a medical speciality that is vitally important for both disease prevention and the treatment of diseases of essentially every organ system roland l weinsier md drph lida my advise to you is that you tell your family members to try to find a physician who has an understanding of the role that vitamins and minerals yes even magnesium may play a role in depression play in depression and who could get a nutritional profile run menopause is often a time when women suffer depression there are a lot of hormonal changes that are occuring but they are not the same ones that occur during pms a nutritionist may also be able to help not too long ago a poster mentioned that his nutritionist had diagnosed a selenium deficiency based on a red cell glutathionine peroxidase test the specific test for the selenium reserve most clinical labs will not run this test and i advised him to try to make sure that the lab that did the test was certified there are also a lot of hair and nail analysis labs setup to do trace mineral analysis but these labs are not regulated checks of these labs using certified standards and also those doing water lead analysis showed some pretty shoddy testing was going on if you or anyone else finds someone who will run these speciality nutrition tests make sure that they are using a lab that has been certified under clia the clinical laboratory improvement act a diet analysis may be helpful since many nutrient reserves have been shown to correlate fairly well with the dietary intake as monitored by food logging and software analysis nutritionist iv and other software programs but there are still about half of the nutrients required by humans that do not show a very good correlation between apparent dietary intake and reserve status until we have more nutritional assessment clinical labs in operation in the u s and physicians who have been trained how to use the nutritional profile that these labs provide to devise a treatment approach that uses diet changes and supplementation anti depressants will probably continue to be the best approach to depression martin banschbach ph d professor of biochemistry and chairman department of biochemistry and microbiology osu college of osteopathic medicine without discourse there is no remembering without remembering there is no learning without

envelope glycoprotein precursor from hiv one produced by microgenesys are advantages rather than disadvantages write franklin volvovitz and gale smith of microgenesys in meriden conn moore et al says that gp one six zero in a baculovirus expression system does not bind strongly to the cd four receptor and that this recombinant gp one six zero does not stimulate the same antibodies as the hiv one virus does in natural infection but vaccination with recombinant gp one six zero in patients infected with hiv one broadens hiv one specific envelope directed immune responses including crossreactive antibodies to gp one six zero epitopes and cd four and cd eight cytotoxic t cell responses volvovitz and smith claim that they never intended their gp one six zero molecule to be identical to the

relatedness of their hiv to that of the dentist death certificates were obtained for deceased patients and the medical records of those with diagnoses suggestive of hiv disease or drug abuse and those dying under the age of five zero years were examined in detail there were one one nine two patients who had undergone nine two six seven procedures of whom one two four were deceased an examination of

health initiatives writes peter duesberg of the university of california berkeley in the lancet s march one three issue schechter et al call duesberg s hypothesis that injected and orally used recreational drugs and azt lead to aids a hindrance to public health initiatives however their hypothesis that hiv is the cause of aids has not attained any public health benefits the u s government spends four billion annually but no vaccine no therapy no prevention and no aids control have resulted from work on this hypothesis schechter et al conclude that hiv has a key role in cd four depletion and aids based on epidemiological correlations with antibodies against hiv and with self reported recreational drug use among homosexuals from vancouver however their survey neglects to disprove duesberg s drug aids hypothesis because it does not provide controls i e confirmed drug free aids cases and because it does not quantify drug use and ignores azt use altogether to refute duesberg s hypothesis schechter would have to produce a controlled study demonstrating that over a period of up to one zero years hiv positive patients who use recreational drugs or azt or both have the same aids risks as positives who do not do so the one zero year period is claimed by hicnet medical newsletter page four five volume six number one one april two five one nine nine three

edu in article rhca eight zero melton sps mot com henry melton writes my wife has requested that i poll the sages of usenet to see what is known about the use of chromium in weight control diet suppliments she has seen multiple products advertising it and would like any kind real information my first impulse was yuck a metal but i have zero data on it what do you know henry melton i ll tell you all that i know about chromium but before i do i want to get a few things off my chest i just got blasted in e mail for my kidney stone posts kidney stones are primarily caused by diet as is heart disease and cancer when i give dietary advise it is not intended to encourage people reading this news group or sci med nutrition where i do most of my posting to avoid seeing a doctor nothing can be further from the truth kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has to be ruled out but once it is diet is a good way of preventing a reoccurance same thing with heart disease and cancer if you suspect that you may have a problem with one of these diseases don t use what i m going to tell you or what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor you have to go hopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to help you change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatment program but the odds are that you will not and that s why i m here when my wife detected a lump in here breast i didn t say don t worry my vitamin e will take care of it any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician plan and simple if it s begnin which most are fine then maybe a diet change and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuring but let me tell you right now if you have tried diet and supplementation and another lump returns get your butt into the doctor s office as fast as your little feet can carry you better yet have a mammography done on a regular basis my wife kept putting her s off both myself and her gynocologist told her she needed to have one done her gynocologist even scheduled one but she didn t show up too busy running the operating room for the biggest hospital in tulsa one more thing i am not an orthomolecular nutritionist this group uses high dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do have drug actions in the body but you talk about flying blind man this is really blind treatment no drug could ever be used as these vitamins and minerals are being used i m not saying that some of this stuff couldn t be right on the money it may well be but my approach to nutrition is a lot like that of weinsier and morgan the two m d s who wrote the new clinical nutrition textbook my push is the nutrient reserves and the lab tests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or diet changes to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let you handle stress that s where i m coming from folks blast away if you want i m not going to change put me in your killfile if you want i really don t care i m averaging eight one zero e mail messages a day from people who think that i ve got something important to say but i m also getting hit by a few with an axe to grind that s life chromium is one of the trace elements it has a very limited but very important role in the body it is used to form glucose tolerance factor gtf gtf is made up of chromium nicinamide niacin glycine cysteine and glutamic only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet to form gtf some foods already have gtf liver brewers or nutritional yeast and black pepper when chromium is in gtf a pretty good absorption is seen about two zero but when it is simply present as a mineral or mineral chelate chromium picolinate it s absorption is much lower one to two lowest for all the minerals i ve been posting in misc fitness and chromium has come up there several times as a fat burner chromium is among the least toxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not really do any harm i wouldn t do it though the adequate and safe range for chromium is five zero to two zero zero ug per day the average american is getting about three zero ug per day from his her diet chromium levels decrease with age and many believe that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency i can cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance in type ii diabetes but i m not going to because for each positive one there also seems to be a negative one as well i m convinced that the problem is bioavailability when yeast gtf is used good results are obtained but when chromium itself is used the results are usually negative in addition to type ii diabetes chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease and glucoma again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease is concerned since a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease this possible link with chromium isn t too surprising glucoma is a little more interesting muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulin responsive glucose driven metabolic function if this eye focusing activity is impaired by a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response intraocular pressure is believed to be elevated in a fairly large study of four zero zero pts with glaucoma the one consistent finding was a low rbc chromium j am coll nutr one zero five five three six one nine nine one but this one preliminary study should not prompt people to go out and start popping chromium supplements for one thing just about every older person is going to have a low rbc chromium unless they have been taking chromium suppleemnts yeast since glucoma is often found in older people it s not too surprising that chromium was low in the rbc s if chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma that would prompt some attention i suspect that there will be a clinical trail to check out this possible chromium link to glucoma you could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the rbc chromium test or hair analysis most clinical labs are not going to run a rbc chromium there are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nail analysis for you but i wouldn t use them there is just too much funny business going on in these unregulated labs right now here s weinsier and morgan advise on chromium they do not consider chromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test is available they don t like the hair and nail analysis labs either and they also recognize the rbc chromium is primarily a research test that is not routinely available in most clinical chemistry labs this has to change and as more labs run a rbc chromiuum it will what then do they suggest make a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinical response to chromium run a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium supplementation once you make the diagnosis put the patient on two zero zero ug of crcl three orally each day or one zero grams of yeast per day what s my advise don t take chromium supplements to try to loose weight they just do not work that way if you want to take them and then exercise that would be great do include yeast as part of your diet most americans are not getting enough chromium from their diet if you do have a poor glucose tolerance ask your doctor to check your chromium status when he or she says what in the world are you talking about just say please get a copy of weinsier and morgan s new clinical nutrition textbook and do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucose tolerance if you can t do that i ll find a doctor who can thank you very much marty b

 from nodrog hardy u washington edu gordon rubenfeld subject re candida yeast bloom fact or fiction article i d shelley one rhfrkinn eight one six organization university of washington lines nine two nntp posting host hardy u washington edu banschbach vms ocom okstate edu writes to candida blooms following the use of broad spectrum antibiotics gorden rubenfeld through e mail has assured me that most physicians recognize the chance of candida blooms occuring after broad spectrum antibiotic use and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with good bacteria to restore competetion for candida in the body i do not believe that this is yet a standard part of medical practice nor is it mine what i tried to explain to marty was that it is clearly understood that antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for fungal infections which is not the same as saying bacteria prevent fungal infections marty made this sound like a secret known only to veternarians and biochemists anyone who has treated a urinary tract infection knowns this at some centers pre op liver transplant patients receive bowel decontamination directed at retaining good anaerobic flora in an attempt to prevent fungal colonization in this soon to be high risk group i also use lactobacillus to treat enteral nutrition associated diarrhea that may be in part due to alterations in gut flora however it is not part of my routine practice to reinnoculate patients with good bacteria after antibiotics i have seen no data on this practice preventing or treating fungal infections in at risk patients whether or not it is a logical extension from the available observations i ll leave to those of you who base strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence of clinical trials one place such therapy has been described is in treating particularly recalcitrant cases of c difficile colitis not a fungal infection there are case reports of using stool ie someone elses enemas to repopulate the patients flora don t try this at home not give give her advise to use the otc anti fungal creams since candida colonizes primarily in the ano rectal area gi symptoms should be more common than vaginal problems after broad spectrum antibiotic use except that it isn t at least symptomatically apparent disease medicine has not and probalby never will be practiced this way there has always been the use of conventional wisdom a very good example is kidney stones conventional wisdom because clinical trails have not been done to come up with an effective prevention was that restricitng the intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to breakdown the stone once it formed through the recent new england j of medicine article we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is restricting calcium intake seems like this is an excellent argument for ignoring anecdotal conventional wisdom a euphemism for no data and doing a good clinical trial like au dismukes w e wade j s lee j y dockery b k hain j d ti a randomized double blind trial of nystatin therapy for the candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome see comments so n engl j med one nine nine zero dec two zero three two three two five p one seven one seven two three psychological tests results the three active treatment regimens and the all placebo regimen significantly reduced both vaginal and systemic symptoms p less than zero zero zero one but nystatin did not reduce the systemic symptoms significantly more than placebo conclusions in women with presumed candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome nystatin does not reduce systemic or psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo consequently the empirical recommendation of long term nystatin therapy for such women appears to be unwarranted does this trial address every issue raised here no jon noring was not surprised at this negative trial since they didn t use sporanox despite crook s recommendation for nystatin maybe they didn t avoid those carbohydrates the conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to be reinnoculated with good bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy if it makes sense for livestock why doesn t it make sense for humans david we are not talking about a dangerous treatment unless you consider yogurt dangerous if this were a standard part of medical practice as gordon r says it is then the incidence of gi distress and vaginal yeast infections should decline marty you ve also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiric itraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemic hypersensitivity symptoms noring syndrome to the yoghurt and vitamin therapy of undocumented candida enteritis elaine palmer syndrome with systemic symptoms there is significant difference between the cost and risk of these two empiric therapeutic trials are we talking about real candida infections the whole yeast connection hypothesis the efficacy of routine bacterial repopulation in humans or the ability of anecdotally effective therapies challenged by a negative randomized trial to confirm an etiologic hypothesis post hoc ergo propter hoc we can t seem to focus in on a disease a therapy or a hypothesis under

 from rhaller ns uoregon edu rich haller subject resound hearing aid theory as i understand it organization university of oregon lines four one distribution world nntp posting host rhaller cc uoregon edu the following is based on copies i was given of some articles published in hearing instruments i would appreciate any comments about this and other new technology for hearing aids the resound system was developed on the basis of some research at at t and appears to take a different approach from other aids it appears to me that a new programmable aid like the widex just uses a more flexible and programmable version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of the spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help out in noisy situations the major difference in the resound approach is that it divides the spectrum into low and high frequencies splitting point is programmable apparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in the low frequencies while the important consonant information unfortunately for me is in the high frequencies the two bands then are treated with different compression schemes which are programable they have also developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call abnormal growth of loudness this latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience though i think the phrase is missleading what appears to be the case is that as you exceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss the deficit becomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach the too loud point the sensitivity curves appear to converge this means that if you just boost all sound levels you are overloading at the high end for people with hearing losses hence what you want is progressively less amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point you want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially differently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum specially for someone like me who is relatively normal up to one zero zero zero cps and then falls off a cliff aids with simple compressors don t descriminate between energy in the low and high frequencies and can therefor compress useful high frequency information because of high volume of low frequency components particularly impressive was the resound performance with whispered speech and in simulated restaurant noise situations rich haller university of oregon eugene or usa

 from banschbach vms ocom okstate edu subject re candida yeast bloom fact or fiction lines one one eight nntp posting host vms ocom okstate edu organization osu college of osteopathic medicine in article nodrog hardy u washington edu gordon rubenfeld writes banschbach vms ocom okstate edu writes to candida blooms following the use of broad spectrum antibiotics gorden rubenfeld through e mail has assured me that most physicians recognize the chance of candida blooms occuring after broad spectrum antibiotic use and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with good bacteria to restore competetion for candida in the body i do not believe that this is yet a standard part of medical practice nor is it mine what i tried to explain to marty was that it is clearly understood that antibiotic exposure is a risk factor for fungal infections which is not the same as saying bacteria prevent fungal infections marty made this sound like a secret known only to veternarians and biochemists anyone who has treated a urinary tract infection knowns this at some centers pre op liver transplant patients receive bowel decontamination directed at retaining good anaerobic flora in an attempt to prevent fungal colonization in this soon to be high risk group i also use lactobacillus to treat enteral nutrition associated diarrhea that may be in part due to alterations in gut flora however it is not part of my routine practice to reinnoculate patients with good bacteria after antibiotics i have seen no data on this practice preventing or treating fungal infections in at risk patients whether or not it is a logical extension from the available observations i ll leave to those of you who base strong opinions and argue over such speculations in the absence of clinical trials one place such therapy has been described is in treating particularly recalcitrant cases of c difficile colitis not a fungal infection there are case reports of using stool ie someone elses enemas to repopulate the patients flora don t try this at home not give give her advise to use the otc anti fungal creams since candida colonizes primarily in the ano rectal area gi symptoms should be more common than vaginal problems after broad spectrum antibiotic use except that it isn t at least symptomatically apparent disease medicine has not and probalby never will be practiced this way there has always been the use of conventional wisdom a very good example is kidney stones conventional wisdom because clinical trails have not been done to come up with an effective prevention was that restricitng the intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to breakdown the stone once it formed through the recent new england j of medicine article we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is restricting calcium intake seems like this is an excellent argument for ignoring anecdotal conventional wisdom a euphemism for no data and doing a good clinical trial like au dismukes w e wade j s lee j y dockery b k hain j d ti a randomized double blind trial of nystatin therapy for the candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome see comments so n engl j med one nine nine zero dec two zero three two three two five p one seven one seven two three psychological tests results the three active treatment regimens and the all placebo regimen significantly reduced both vaginal and systemic symptoms p less than zero zero zero one but nystatin did not reduce the systemic symptoms significantly more than placebo conclusions in women with presumed candidiasis hypersensitivity syndrome nystatin does not reduce systemic or psychological symptoms significantly more than placebo consequently the empirical recommendation of long term nystatin therapy for such women appears to be unwarranted does this trial address every issue raised here no jon noring was not surprised at this negative trial since they didn t use sporanox despite crook s recommendation for nystatin maybe they didn t avoid those carbohydrates the conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to be reinnoculated with good bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy if it makes sense for livestock why doesn t it make sense for humans david we are not talking about a dangerous treatment unless you consider yogurt dangerous if this were a standard part of medical practice as gordon r says it is then the incidence of gi distress and vaginal yeast infections should decline marty you ve also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiric itraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemic hypersensitivity symptoms noring syndrome to the yoghurt and vitamin therapy of undocumented candida enteritis elaine palmer syndrome with systemic symptoms there is significant difference between the cost and risk of these two empiric therapeutic trials are we talking about real candida infections the whole yeast connection hypothesis the efficacy of routine bacterial repopulation in humans or the ability of anecdotally effective therapies challenged by a negative randomized trial to confirm an etiologic hypothesis post hoc ergo propter hoc we can t seem to focus in on a disease a therapy or a hypothesis under discussion i m lost candida can do that to you gordon i think that the best clinical trial for candida blooms would involve giving women with chronic vaginal candida blooms l acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease the frequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of the candida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and l acidophilus should be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through the intestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access to oxygen just like it does in the vagina as much stuff as there is in the lay press about l acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections i m really amazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out the calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw all conventional wisdom out the window where would medicine be if conventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standard medical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trials the clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical scene and a very important one the lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteria after antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reason to dismiss it out of hand especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaply and safely like it is in animal husbandry marty b

 from banschbach vms ocom okstate edu subject re robert s biological alchemy lines one zero six nntp posting host vms ocom okstate edu organization osu college of osteopathic medicine robert i m so glad that you posted your biological alchemy discussion i ve been compared to the famous robert mcelwaine by some readers of sci med i didn t know how to respond since i had not seen one of your posts just like i haven t read the yeast connection let me just start by stating that the authors of the cold fusion papers of recent years are now in scientific exile i believe that one has actually left the country scientific fraud is rare i m still not sure that if a review of the research notes of the cold fusion scientists actually proved fraud or just very shoddy experimentation your sources do not seem to be research articles they are more like lay texts designed to pique human interest in a subject area just like the food combining and life extension texts robert i try to keep an open mind but some things i just can t buy one is taking sod orally to prevent oxidative damage in the body your experiment if conducted by readers of this news group would prove that you are right more ash after seed sprouting than before unless you use a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperature above six zero zero degrees i believe you will get organic residue in the ash even the residue in commercial incinerators contains organic residue i remember doing this kind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in college but i couldn t find a temperature for mineral ash formation so i m really guessing at six zero zero degrees f it may actually be much higher the point is that no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature to produce only a mineral ash they also could not measure the minerals so they could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct chemical reactions abound in our body in our atmosphere in our water and in our soil are these fusion reactions yes many of them do involve fusing oxygen nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and inorganics do we really have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused with silicon not in my book robert silicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet i ve seen speculation that man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbon based life form i like reading science fiction as many people do but i know enough about biochemistry and nutrition to be able in most cases to separate the fiction from the fact silicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential in humans we have several grams of the stuff in our body what s it doing there only the lord knows right now but i will tell you what i do know about silicon and why as you state it helps bone healing and it is not because silicon is transformed into calcium almost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connective tissue collagen and elastin there have been studies published which show that the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective factor against atherosclerosis the higher the silicon content in elastin the more resistant the elastin is to a an age related loss of elasticity which may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as part of the ageing process in humans for bone fracture healing the first step is a collagen matrix into which calcium and phosphate are pumped by osteoblasts a high level of silicon in the diet seems to speed up this matrix formation this first step in the bone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get going electriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix forming cells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed in the gap or gaps between the ends of the broken bone a vitamin c deficiency by slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution of defective collagen does slow down both bone and wound healing zinc is also another big player in bone and wound healing and so is silicon in an undetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and not transformation of silicon to calcium for you to take this bone healing observation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed into calcium is an interesting little trick but robert i have the same problem myself when i read the lay press and yes even some scientific papers is the explanation reasonable without a very good science knowledge base you and most readers of this news group are flying blind you have to take it on faith because you don t know any better if the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge base i m inclined to consider it this usually means trying to find other sources that come to the same conclusion if the idea like a candida bloom seems to make sense to me i tend to pursue it as long as any advice that i m going to give isn t going to really mess somebody up if this makes us kindred souls robert then i guess i ll have to live with that label for the physicians who have decided to read my response to robert s interesting post i hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric neurosurgeon last night on u s tv i can t remember the network or his name like many nights i was on my computer and my wife was watching tv in our den where i have my computer setup this neurosurgeon takes kids with brain tumors that everyone else has given up on and he uses unconventional treatments his own words he says that he has a seven zero success rate the one case that i heard him discussing would normally use radiation conventional treatment he was going to go in and cut you guys complain about the cost of the anti fungals what do you think the cost difference between radiation treatment and surgery is guys i m going to ask you guys one more time why blast a physician who takes the chronic sinus sufferer like jon and the chronic gi sufferer like elaine and tries to help them using unconventional treatments treatments which do not result in death like those that the neurosurgeon uses is it because candida blooms are not life threatening while brain tumors are how about quality of life guys may the candida demon never cross your sinus cavity or gut if it does you may feel differently about the issue marty b

one zero nine in article nodrog hardy u washington edu gordon rubenfeld writes marty you ve also changed the terrain of the discussion from empiric itraconazole for undocumented chronic fungal sinusitis with systemic hypersensitivity symptoms noring syndrome to the yoghurt and vitamin therapy of undocumented candida enteritis elaine palmer syndrome with systemic symptoms there is significant difference between the cost and risk of these two empiric therapeutic trials are we talking about real candida infections the whole yeast connection hypothesis the efficacy of routine bacterial repopulation in humans or the ability of anecdotally effective therapies challenged by a negative randomized trial to confirm an etiologic hypothesis post hoc ergo propter hoc we can t seem to focus in on a disease a therapy or a hypothesis under discussion i m lost point one i m beginning to see that part of the disagreements about the whole yeast issue is on differing perceptions and on differing meanings of words medical doctors have a very specific and specialized jargon necessary for precise communication within their field which i m fully cognizant of since i too speak jargonese when with my peers for the situation in sci med many times the words or phrases used by doctors can have a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the world at large causing significant miscommunication one example word and very relevant to the yeast discussion is the exact meaning of systemic it is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific much more so than its meaning to a non doctor there is also the observation of this newsgroup that both doctors and non doctors come together on essentially equal terms which when combined with the jargon issue can further fan the flames this is probably the first time that practicing doctors get really beat up by non doctors for their views on medicine which they otherwise don t see much of in their practice except for the occasional difficult patient point two i understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not prescribe any treatments therapies for their patients unless such treatments have been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well constructed clinical trials usually double blind or that such treatments therapies are part of an approved and funded clinical trial to these doctors to do any differently would in this belief system be unethical practice and it follows that any therapy not on the accepted list is therefore a non therapy it does not even exist nor does the underlying hypothesis or theory have any validity even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation of what is currently known anecdotal evidence has no value either from a treatment point of view and by and large as a scientist myself i am glad that medical practice science takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment however as also being a human being last i checked and having been one of those people that has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment where standard medicine was not able to help me has caused me to sit back and wonder if holding such an extreme and rigid scientific viewpoint is in itself unethical from humanitarian considerations after all the underlying intent of the scientific approach to medicine is to protect the health of the patient by providing the best possible care for the patient so the patient should come first when considering treatment what we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both the scientific and the humanitarian viewpoints in an earlier post i outlined a crazy idea for doing just that the gist of it was to give any physician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe alternate not yet proven therapies maybe supported by anecdotal evidence for patients who all avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted and not until then the patient would be fully informed that such therapies treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that there are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived from them this approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor it also satisfies the humanitarian needs of the patient and the reality is that many patients who have reached a dead end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted medicine will go outside the orthodox medical community either to the doctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing their license or worse to non doctors who have not had the proper medical training this approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control more within orthodox medicine with the benefits that the information gleaned could help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most productive way everybody wins in this admittedly rose colored approach i m sure there are real problems with this approach as well it is presented more as a strawman to stimulate discussion hopefully what i write here may give the sci med doctors a better idea as to why i am open to alternative therapies as well as why i have real difficulty read apparent hostility with the coldness of the nine nine nine pure scientific approach to medicine i believe the best approach to medical treatment is one where both the humanitarian aspects are balanced with and by the scientific aspects anything else is just not good medicine imho just my nf leanings i guess comments jon

 from aldridge netcom com jacquelin aldridge subject re cholistasis sp fat free diet pregnancy organization netcom on line communication services four zero eight two four one nine seven six zero guest lines one two three heart access digex com g writes hi i ve just returned from a visit with my ob gyn and i have a few concerns that maybe y all can help me with i ve been seeing her every four weeks for the past few months i m at week two eight and during the last two visits i ve gained nine to nine one two pounds every four weeks she said this was unacceptable over any four week period as it stands i ve thus far gained two six pounds also she says that though i m at two eight weeks the baby s size is two seven weeks i think she mentioned two seven inches for the top of the fundus when i was one three weeks the baby s size was one four weeks i must also add that i had an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and i ve had no problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain in my pelvic region during the pregnancy and i have a very difficult time moving and the doc has recommended i not walk or move unless i have to i have a little handicapped sticker for when i do need to go out anyway that s one two of the situation the other is that almost from the beginning of pregnancy i was getting sick throwing up about two three times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated i told her about this i know this because i wasn t eating very much due to the nausea and could see the results well now i only get sick about once every one two weeks and it is still bile related but in addition i had begun to feel movement near my upper right abdomen just below the right breast usually when i was lying on my right side it began to get worse though because it started to hurt when i lay on my right side and then it hurt no matter what position i was in next i noticed that when i ate greasy or fatty foods i felt like my entire abdomen had turned to stone and the pain in the area got worse however if i ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to cut the fat it wasn t as much of a problem so the doctor says i have cholistatis and that i should avoid fatty foods this makes sense and because i was already aware of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship i have been avoiding these foods on my own but i m still able to eat foods with ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods but doc wants me to be on a non fat diet this means no meat except fish and chicken w o skin i do this anyway no nuts fried food cheese etc i am allowed skim milk she said i should avoid anything sweet e g bananas also i must only have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day potatoes pasta rice she said i can t even cook vegetables in a little bit of oil and that i should eat vegetables raw or steamed i m concerned because i understand you need to have some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process and if i m not taking in fat is she expecting the baby will take it from my stores and why this restriction on carbohydrates if she s concerned about fat i m not clear how much of her recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on cholistatis which i can t seem to find any information on she originally said that i should only gain two zero pounds during the entire pregnancy since i was about two zero lbs overweight when i started but my sister gained six zero lbs during her pregnancy and she s taken it all off and hasn t had any problems she also asked if any members of my family were obese which none of them are anyway i think she is overly concerned about weight gain and feel like i m being punished by a severe diet she did want to see me again in one week so i think she the diet may be temporary for that one week what i want to know is how reasonable is this non fat diet i would understand if she had said low fat diet since i m trying that anyway even if she said really low fat diet i think she assumes i must be eating a high fat diet but really it is that because of the endometriosis and the operation i m not able to use the energy from the food i do eat any opinions info and experiences will be appreciated i m truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet because fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few minutes and i ll end up having to eat constantly thus far i don t find any foods satisfying thanks g for one week she probably wants to see how you react to the diet if it changes anything you can live on the diet but you need to up your calories where before you had a pat of butter now you need a medium apple probably microwave cooked smaller meals but more of them not terrific amounts of meat it s hard to digest anyway for comfort and to make the carbohydrate meal last longer eat pasta or rice which give their calories up slowly rather than bread or corn maybe smaller meals as you may be getting less room in the stomach area is the baby still coming up is it starting to push or rub under your ribs how tight are your clothes you shouldn t be wearing any clothing that compresses your middle be sure not to suck in your stomach when sitting again it will put pressure on the digestive tract try laying on your sides back and stay in reclining positions for the many hours you are being inactive easier on your legs circulation as well you might try letting the baby turn or at least not be forced under the ribs during the last months when you are shortwaisted it s easy for that baby to end up right under the diaphram especially if you have tight abdominal muscles if i had my second one to do over again i think i d have tried to loosen up since he didn t turn sideways until late and the relief was enormous maybe this doctor does have a thing about weight gain in pregnancy or maybe she just nags all her patients this way especially if she s young but this gallbladder whatever problem that might be coming up is something to be avoided if possible nausea etc can vary from person to person and with each pregnancy my first pregnancy was miserable during the second i had very little trouble some articles have said that women with nausea had a statistically better chance of carrying their baby grain of salt here good luck jackie

posts on protein vitamin c and vitamin a prior to posting on internet as a professional courtesy somehow i ve managed to delete my vitamin a post from my text file gordon r had promised to send it back to me but he s pretty mad at me right now so i ll just retype it since digging through all my references is very time consuming took me all day for that pms post i m not going to cite any references gordon r has them i m going to include some of the material from weinsier and morgan s new nutrition textbook which was not in my original material to point out that what i m going to say has some support in the medical community diet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very very long time protein has always had the biggest role in infection and i ve already covered the role of protein in protecting you against infection now i m going to hit what i consider to be the most important nutrient in the u s as far as infection is concerned vitamin a when vitamin a was originally discovered it was commonly referred to as the anti infection vitamin many people linus pauling being one have decided to take this title away from vitamin a and give it to vitamin c which i ve already covered big mistake in my opinion vitamin a is also getting a reputation as an anti cancer vitamin with good reason the nci currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see if vitamin a can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well it s role in both cancer and infection is almost identical but not quite vitamin a comes in two completely different forms retinol and beta carotene retinol is the animal form and it s toxic beta carotene is the plant form and it s completely nontoxic both retinol and beta carotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present six zero eight zero the liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for other tissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding protein rbp a normal human adult liver should have five zero zero zero zero zero iu to one zero zero zero zero zero zero iu of retinol stored we are born with one zero zero zero zero iu in our liver u s autopsy has shown that about three zero of americans die with the same or less amount of vitamin a as they were born with if you don t believe that nutritional reserves like that of retinol in the liver are important then this low vitamin a reserve is not going to affect you but if you believe like i do that the nutrient reserves are important then there is a problem with vitamin a in the u s the u s rda for vitamin a in an adult male is one zero zero zero re or five zero zero zero iu of vitamin a for adult feamles its eight zero zero re or four zero zero zero iu of vitamin a diet surveys show that most americans are getting this amount of vitamin a either retinol or beta carotene from their diet but the nrc national research council was going to release a new rda table in one nine eight five that had the rda for both vitamin a and vitamin c raised c to nine zero mg per day and a to seven five zero zero iu per day for adult males that report and it s recommendations was killed why concern over the increasing supplementation was the main reason rdas are set to prevent clinical disease not to keep nutrient reserves full many scientist in the u s feel that the time has come to move away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move towards the promotion of optimum health concept especially since we have some very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremely important during periods of stress the nutritonal concervatives won that battle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the one nine eight nine rda list which lowered the rda for several nutrients and moved the dietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the one nine four zero s get enough to prevent clinical pathology but not enough to fill the reserves we know from autopsy that only about one zero of americans have a liver with a normal vitamin a reserve five zero zero zero zero zero iu to one zero zero zero zero zero zero iu i preach nutrient reserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patients but for vitamin a only a liver biopsy or autopsy data will tell you how much somebody has stored we can tell very easily if someone has overfilled his or her liver with vitamin a by measuring the serium retinol level levels above four five zero ug dl are highly suggestive that you have filled your liver with vitamin a and it s time to stop taking retinol the normal range of serum retinol will be two zero one zero zero ug dl hypervitaminosis a is diagnosed with a serum retinol level of two zero zero zero ug dl or higher interpretation of diagnostic test wallach m d a little brown series book this level of vitamin a in blood means that medical attention is necessary due to vitamin a toxicity weinsier and morgan take a much more conservative approach to vitamin a toxicity than does wallach as you will see later in this post between four five zero ug dl and two zero zero zero ug dl you should have plenty of warning that it s time to eliminate the retinol from your diet headache redness of the skin hair loss joint pain i tell all my students that will use vitamin a in their practice that they had better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clear signs that the liver is full you will never really know if the patient needs the vitamin a because you can not measure the pool in liver but you will always know when it s time to stop just like in those vitamin a for pms studies beta carotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you will never have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of beta carotene to retinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow down stops in the liver and slows down in the gut when your liver is full of retinol but taking beta carotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time to fill the liver up i ve seen estimates of two zero three zero years if you are in the three zero that only has as much as you were born with in your liver one zero zero zero zero iu one other problem with beta carotene if you have a zinc deficit you will not convert as much beta carotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the enxzyme that does this conversion requires zinc in addition the release of retinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit will cause a vitamin a deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin a now what does vitamin a do in cancer and infection protection the body uses vitamin a retinol for many different things vision the first to be nailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology uses the aldehyde retinal and alcohol retinol form of vitamin a reproduction uses the retinol form and some retinal infection and cancer protection uses retinoic acid how do you convert retinol which your white blood cells and the mucosal cells get from blood to retinoic acid you use enzymes one of which requires vitamin c this is why pauling has tried to pull the title of anti infection vitamin away from vitamin a vitamin c does play a role in infection interferon production for example but it s biggest role is the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid if you increase your intake of vitamin c you will increase your formation of retinoic acid but retinoic acid can not be converted back to retinol as retinal can and once it s formed it s used and then lost to the body this is why the one nine eight five nrc group wanted to increase both vitamin c and vitamin a rda s most people taking large amounts of vitamin c really think that they are helping themselves if they don t have much vitamin a in their liver and they are not also increasing their intake of vitamin a they actually do themselves more harm than good retinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formation in the mucus membrane it is the main factor in promoting good mucus production and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents from entering the blood system the mucus membrane is referred to as the first line defense against infection for cancer retinoic acid has been shown to act as a cell brake it counteracts the effect of cell promoters which stimulate cells to divide cancer has two distinct steps dna alteration and cell promotion for cells that normally divide all the time promoters are not that important but for lung and breast tissue which does not normally divide promoters are real important in the malignant process this is the major reason why the nci has so many different clinical trials in progress using retinol and or beta carotene chronic infection irritation of the mucus membranes is a signal that vitamin a may not be adequate i tell my students that any patient who walks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to be worked up for vitamin a along with the other factors that medicine already has on it s list of causes for chronic infection i drive this home in my course at the osteopathic college in tulsa when i teach at the allopathic medical school in tulsa ou s branch campus and when i give cme lectures dark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin a status since night vision is impacted when liver reverves drop to five zero zero zero zero iu of retinol the serum level of retinol can also be used but it does not drop until liver reserves drop below one zero zero zero zero to two zero zero zero zero iu asking a patient if they have trouble seeing at night is a good initial screen if cataracts are ruled out in one study done on u s spanish americans where serum retinol levels were measured two five of the sample population had a serum retinol level below two zero ug dl as more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups of the u s that have had a history of high infection rates we will probably see a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and low serum retinol levels what do weinsier and morgan have to say about vitamin a here are excerpts from their book vitamin a functions in vision in the forrm of retinol it is necessay for growth and differentation of epithelial tissue and is required for reproduction embryonic development and bone growth protein calorie malnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption transport and metabolism of vitamin a retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid which has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not in reproduction or vision the most common procedure to evaluate vitamin a status is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum the normal range for vitamin a content for a child is two zero to nine zero ug dl lower values are indicators of deficiency or depleted body stores serum levels greater than one zero zero ug dl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin a dark adaptation tests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult to perform on young children rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive to vitamin a deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state the bronchorespiratory tract skin genitourinary system gastrointestinal tract and sweat glands are adversely affected a daily intake of more than seven five mg about three seven zero zero zero iu of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amounts over two zero mg one zero zero zero zero zero iu can result in a dry and itching skin desquamation erythematous dermatitis hair loss joint pain chapped lips hyperostois bony depositis headaches anorexia edema and fatigue they recommend three zero mg of retinol via im injection in children for vitamin a deficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults their toxic serum retinol level is very conservative i recommend that my students try two five zero zero zero iu in adults that are having problems with chronic infection they have to rule out a zinc deficit first by getting an rbc zinc run or if their clinical lab can t run it i tell them to do what weinsier and morgan suggest give them the zinc along with the vitamin a at two five zero zero zero iu per day toxicity should not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling the patient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinol both elaine and jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin a recall that the pms papers were using one zero zero zero zero zero iu to two zero zero zero zero zero iu of vitamin a i don t suggest that my students use these high doses if you wanted to fill the liver up fast as part of a clinical trial and were monitoring the serum retinol level then you would be okay but my knowledge of the vitamin a literature suggests to me that two five zero zero zero iu for patients with a demonstrated vitamin a deficit dark adapatation test or serum retinol will provide a good and steady improvement as long as zinc and vitamin c status are good without having to worry about toxicity if they want to get more agressive fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol but vitamin a retinol should never be given in high dose to women who could become pregnant since vitamin a shows teratogenicity towards the human fetus the dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is one eight zero zero zero iu of retinol per day beta carotene will never have this effect on the human fetus could just taking beta carotene instead of retinol supplements help yes but the effect will take a long time to develop my advise is to use retinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta carotene to keep it full vitamin a is probably one nutrient that is better off left to prescription by doctors but when we have the m d s in this newsgroup jumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin a supplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and gi distress i think that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin a in the otc market but require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the general public about the dangers of vitamin a supplementation marty b

one zero it was commissioned by some whiny consumers group called families usa the poll tells us that the majority of americans believe that doctors make too much money the pollsters also asked what a fair income would be for physicians those polled said oh about eight zero zero zero zero a year would be ok how generous how sporting how stupid why is this poll stupid because it is based on resentment and envy two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign and are still simmering you could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that earns one zero zero zero zero zero plus and get the same results since the majority of americans don t make those bucks they assume that those who do are stealing it from them maybe the berlin wall came down but don t kid yourself karl marx lives it s also stupid because it didn t ask key questions such as do you know how much education and training it takes to become a physician if those polled said no they didn t know then they should have been disqualified if they gave the wrong answers they should have been dropped what good are their views on how much a doctor should earn if they don t know what it takes to become a doctor or maybe a question should have been phrased this way how much should a person earn if he or she must a get excellent grades and a fine educational foundation in high school in order to b be accepted by

the power happy ego tripping program spewing social tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is to health what clinton s first budget is to frugality but propaganda works and as the

lipid metabolism at oregon health sciences university over the past two five years dr connor and his team have characterized the food and nutrient intakes of the tara humara indians in mexico while simultaneously documenting various aspects of tarahumara lipid metabolism these native mexicans number approximately five zero zero zero zero and reside in the sierra madre occidental mountains in the state of chihuahua the tarahumaras have coupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing probably as a result coronary heart disease which is so prevalent in western industrialized nations is virtually non existent in their culture loosely translated the name tarahumara means fleet of foot reflecting a tribal passion for betting on kickball races in which participants run distances of one zero zero miles or more while kicking a machete carved wooden ball the typical tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans tortillas and pinole a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water together with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables the tara humaras also eat small amounts of game fish and eggs their food contains approximately one two percent of total calories as fat of which the majority six nine percent is of vegetable origin dietician martha mcmurry a coinvestigator in the study describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while low in cholesterol and fat the tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of one two one mg dl low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol levels of seven two mg dl and high density lipoprotein hdl cholesterol levels of three two to four two mg dl all of those values are in the good low risk range according to the researchers elevated cholesterol and ldl cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart hicnet medical newsletter page two zero volume six number one one april two five one nine nine three disease hdl cholesterol is considered beneficial in previous studies the tarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease although able to respond to high cholesterol diets with elevations in total and ldl cholesterol clinical research center dietitian mcmurry and coinvestigator maria teresa cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a jesuit mission school building near a community hospital in the small village of sisoguichi food was weighed cooked and fed to the study participants under the investigators direct supervision ensuring that subjects ate only food stipulated by the research protocol fasting blood was drawn twice weekly and plasma samples were frozen and shipped to dr connors laboratory for cholesterol triglyceride and lipoprotein analyses regular measurements included participant body weight height and triceps skin fold thickness thirteen tarahumaras five women and eight men including one adolescent were fed their native diet for one week followed by five weeks of an affluent diet in this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was four zero percent of total calories this is the prototype of the holiday diet that many americans consume a diet high in fat sugar and cholesterol low in fiber elaborates dr conners such dietary characteristics are reflected in the cholesterol saturation index or csi recently devised research dietitian sonja conner working with dr connor the csi is a single number that incorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in the diet csi indicates the diet s potential to elevate the cholesterol level particularly the ldl dr connor explains the tarahumaran diet averages a very low csi of two zero dr connor s affluent diet used in the study ranks a csi of one four nine the experimental design of this study reflects the importance of establishing baseline plasma lipid levels typical of the native diet before exposing subjects to the experimental diet the standard curve relating dietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off or plateau for consumption of large amounts of fat changes in dietary fat and or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels you must have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put into the experimental diet the framingham study for example did not discriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease because the diet was already high in fat all subjects were already eating on a plateau dr connor says after five weeks of consuming the affluent diet the subjects mean plasma cholesterol levels had in creased by three one percent primarily in the ldl fraction which rose three nine percent hdl cholesterol increased by three one per cent and ldl to hdl ratios changed therefore very little plasma triglyceride levels increased by one eight percent and subjects averaged an eight pound gain in weight according to dr connor lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon yielding nearly the same results after seven days of affluent diet as after three five days hicnet medical newsletter page two one volume six number one one april two five one nine nine three the increase in hdl carries broad dietary implications for industrialized nations we think hdl cholesterol increased because we increased the amount of dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous tarahumara metabolic study in that study we saw no change in hdl levels after raising the dietary cholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption in the present study we increased fat intake to four zero percent of the total calories we reached the conclusion in the tarahumara study that hdl reflects the amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary cholesterol hdl must increase to help metabolize the fat and it increased quite a bit in this study dr connor explains low hdl in the tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of coronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of fat or cholesterol hdl remains an important predictor to americans because of their usual high fat intake dr connor recommends a diet for americans that contains less than two zero percent of total calories as fat less than one zero zero mg of cholesterol and a csi around two zero varying in accordance with caloric needs such a diet is low in meat and dairy fat high in fiber dr connor also comments on recent suggestions that americans adopt a mediterranean style diet the original mediterranean diet in its pristine state consisted of a very low intake of fat and very few animal and dairy products we are already eating a lot of meat and dairy products simply to continue that pattern while switching to olive oil is not going to help the situation the world health organization who is focusing much attention on the emergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies undergoing technological development dr connor says that coronary heart disease starts with a given society s elite who typically eat a different diet than the average citizen if the pattern of afluence increases the entire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease which places a termendous health care burden on a society who would like the developing countries to prevent coronary heart disease so they can concentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public health measures to improve general well being rather than paying for unnecessary expensive medical technology dr connors says the overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move their plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high risk range within a very short time by an affluent excessive diet the present rate of coronary heart disease in the united states is three zero percent less than it was two zero years ago so a lot has been accomplished we are changing rapidly he concludes hicnet medical newsletter page two two volume six number one one april two five one

from huntington medical research institutes new method for diagnosing alzheimer s disease discovered at huntington medical research institutes results to be reported to national desk health writer contact john lockhart or belinda gerber three one zero four four four seven zero zero zero or eight zero zero five two two eight eight seven seven for the huntington medical research institutes los angeles april two eight a new method for diagnosing and measuring chemical imbalances in the brain which lead to alzheimer s disease and other dementias has been discovered by researchers at the huntington medical research institutes hmri in pasadena calif results of their research will be reported in the may issue of the scientific journal radiology using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging mri called magnetic resonance spectroscopy mrs a research team led by brian d ross m d d phil conducted a study on two one elderly patients who were believed to be suffering from some form of dementia the exams used standard mri equipment fitted with special software developed at hmri called clinical proton mrs clinical proton mrs is easily applied giving doctors confirmatory diagnoses in less than three zero minutes an automated version of clinical proton mrs called proton brain examination probe reduces the examination time yet further providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than one zero minutes by comparison the current standard of care in testing for alzheimer s disease calls for lengthy memory function and neuropsychological tests which can be very upsetting to the patient are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy in addition to alzheimer s disease the new clinical proton mrs exam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias including aids related dementia parkinson s disease and huntington s disease we ve developed a simple test which can be administered quickly and relatively inexpensively using existing mri equipment fitted with either the mrs or probe software said dr ross adding this will help physicians to diagnose alzheimer s earlier and intervene with therapeutics before the progression of the disease causes further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain dr ross and his hmri team measured a family of chemicals in the brain known as inositols and myo inositol mi acted as a marker in the study in comparison to healthy patients those diagnosed with alzheimer s showed a two two percent increase in mi while their level of another chemical called n acetylaspartate naa was significantly lower indicating a loss of brain stimulating neurons believed to be associated with the progression of the disease current drug therapy for alzheimer s disease is widely considered to be inadequate this is attributable dr ross believes to the theory that alzheimer s is caused by an interruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine to the nerve cells this belief has been adhered to over the last one five years and consequently most drugs to treat alzheimer s were based on the changing receptors for acetylcholine physicians have a real need for a test to differentiate alzheimer s from other dementias to provide the patient and his or her family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatment protocols for the treatment of this disease for this reason we consider this test a major advancement in medicine said bruce miller m d a noted neurologist at harbor ucla mrs researcher and a co author of the study other members of the hmri research team included rex a moats ph d truda shonk b s thomas ernst ph d and suzanne woolley r n the probe software can be fitted on the approximately one two zero zero general electric mri units currently in use in the united states and will be configured for other manufacturers mri units soon for interviews with dr ross advance copies of the radiology may issue and other information please contact john lockhart or belinda gerber for

s disease ad is an incurable degenerative disease of the brain first described in one nine zero six by the german neuropathologist alois alzheimer as the disease progresses it leads to loss of memory and mental functioning followed by changes in personality loss of control of bodily functions and eventually death how many people does it affect alzheimer s disease affects an estimated four million adults in the united states and is the fourth leading cause of death taking approximately one zero zero zero zero zero lives each year while alzheimer s debilitates its victims it is equally devastating both emotionally and financially for patients families ad is the most common cause of dementia in adults symptoms worsen every year and death usually occurs within one zero years of initial onset what are its signs and symptoms although the cause of ad is not known two risk factors have been identified advanced age and genetic predisposition the risk of developing ad is less than one percent before the age of five zero yars old but increases steeply in each successive decade of life to reach three zero percent by the age of nine zero in patients with familial ad immediate family relatives have a five zero percent chance of developing ad one of its first symptoms is severe forgetfulness caused by short term memory loss dr herman weinreb of the school of medicine at new york university says whether forgetfulness is a serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree and suggests the following criteria forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently is normal forgetting the name of a loved one is serious forgetting where you left your keys is normal forgetting how to get home is serious doctors suggest that people with severe symptoms should be evaluated

from dyer spdcc com steve dyer writes sez you such an effect in humans has not been demonstrated in any controlled studies infant mice and other models are useful as far as they go but they re not relevant to the matter at hand which is not to say that i favor its use in things like baby food a patently ridiculous use of the additive but we have no reason to believe that msg in the diet effects humans adversely well i know that msg effects me adversely maybe not permanently but at least temporarily enough that i like to try to avoid the stuff from kiran village com kiran wagle writes if you don t like additives then for godsake get off the net and learn to cook from scratch sheesh excuse me why can t people learn to cook from scratch on the net i ve gotten lots of recipes off the net that don t use additives if you like additives then get off the net and go to your local supermarket buy lots of packaged foods and you get off the net is it to cover up the fact that the recipes are not very good or the food is poor quality yes and you buy it says something about your taste eh i don t and what happens when the companies forced to submit to your silly notions go out of business because nobody wants to buy their overpriced bad food removing preservatives directly raises food costs by reducing shelf life hey i ll pay my hard earned dollars to buy food that costs more but does not have preservatives i choose to speak with my pocketbook in many ways from kiran village com kiran wagle you have a good point msg is commonly used in soups in bottled sauces in seasoning mixtures and in the coating on barbecue potato chips nacho cheese doritos breading for many frozen fried foods like fish and chicken etc ad naseum if msg is really the problem we should call this barbecue potato chip syndrome or maybe diner syndrome or the and other natural flavorings syndrome it s been a few years since i ve bought anything labelled with and other natural flavorings from kiran village com kiran wagle the reaction came the time the msg was in the food that was the only difference same restaurant same ingredients how do you know this in order to demonstrate your claim you would have had to supervise the preparation on both occasions perhaps they used msg both times and lied about it perhaps once they used something that had begun to spoil and produced some bizarre toxin that you re allergic to well i had had similar reactions many times that was when i really started watching carefully reaction to doritos hey guess what s in there reaction to lawry s season salt guess what s in there i ll give you a hint i ve had enough problems with many many many different products with msg that i figured out one thing unless i plan on getting sick i won t eat the stuff without my seldane and did i ever learn to read labels please note that i am not saying you are making it up i am just trying to point out that the situation is not always as simple as it might seem which was why i started checking every time i got sick and every time i got sick msg was somehow involved in one of the food products and consider there were no other similar ingredients to my knowledge it might not please a medical researcher but it pleased my own personal physician enough for him to give me allergy medicine and most importantly it s enough proof for me to avoid it and enough proof that my incredibly frugal fiance didn t flinch when i literally threw out or gave away all the food products in his pantry that had msg and he always flinches when there s waste but it was a simple explanation i won t eat this stuff i won t cook with this stuff so i can either throw it out or give it away from pattee ucsu colorado edu donna pattee my guess was that the spice mix on the fries contained msg probably lawry s seasoning salt i love the way that tastes i m not saying i never consume anything with msg i ve noticed that i have a certain tolerance level like a small bag of bbq chips once a month or so it not a problem but that same bag of chips will bother me if i also had chicken bouillon yesterday and lunch at one of the chinese restaurants the day before from kelley healthy uwaterloo ca catherine l kelley all that s needed now is that final step a double blind study done on humans there isn t even an ethical question about possible harm as this is a widely used and approved food additive but some say that only two of the population has a problem with msg some say it s more like two zero but let s say that it s five how many people would have to be tested that would have a problem also i know i have a problem with it and i wouldn t volunteer for a test like thanks guys but i don t want to get sick also i m sure that most people probably have varying degrees of sensitivities at different times if i have a cold i m much more susceptible to the reaction than when i m healthy as proven today when i m stuffy but for some silly reason i still gave in and decided to have the bbq chips from kiran village com kiran wagle because too many of you generic rhetorical you not you cathy go around calling this chinese restaurant syndrome thus suggesting to the people you complain to that you experience this only from chinese food msg is prevalent in a lot more things than chinese food thats why i suggested calling this diner syndrome cathy doesn t i haven t saved all my postings but i never called it chinese restaurant syndrome and i never stated i got it only from chinese food i just thought it would be easiest to conduct my personal test at a chinese take out place that i knew would hold or not hold the msg i can t call up whoever makes doritos and ask them to make me one back of chips without msg on the other hand if one complains about potatoes from a mix or restaurant spice mixes i m going to believe them and if anyone says they got msg sick after eating too many barbecue potato chips at a party i m really going to believe them well i believe i mentioned that in an earlier post let s see you wrote this message at date two zero apr one nine nine three zero zero zero nine three one zero five zero zero but on date one nine apr one nine nine three one six three three one eight gmt i wrote has anyone had an msg reaction from something other than a chinese restaurant lots of times that s why it was so hard for me to pin down i would probably have been easier if i d only have the reaction in a certain type of restaurant but i ve had the reaction in chinese restaurants and greek restaurants and italian restaurants and steak places i can tell you when a steak joint uses accent to tenderize their meat oh and just in case anyone thinks i m prejudice against either chinese food or asian people i m not going home to cook some

 from banschbach vms ocom okstate edu subject pms can it be prevented by a diet change lines two seven four nntp posting host vms ocom okstate edu organization osu college of osteopathic medicine this question came up in sci med nutrition and i m posting my answer here only two two medical schools in the u s teach courses on human nutrition we have already seen what a lack of nutrition education can do when candida and kidney stones present themselves to the medical community i think that the best example of where u s medicine is really missing the mark when it comes to a knowledge of nutrition is pms so many women and their husbands suffer from this disorder that it is really criminal that most physicians in the u s are not taught that pms is primarily caused by diet and diet changes can prevent it from ever happpening before shooting your flames read the entire article and then decide if flaming is justified from a poster in sci medi nutrition in a psychological anthropology course i am taking we got sidetracked onto a short conversation about pms some rumors shared by several of the students included ideas that vitamin levels sugar intake and caffeine intake might affect pms symptoms is there any data on this or is it just so much hooey many thanks michael i ve wanted to reply to this post ever since i saw it but i got side tracked with candida pms is a lot like candida blooms most physicians don t recognize it as a specific disease entity here is everything that you would ever want to know about pms premenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups pmt a anxiety pmt d depression anxiety depression irritability forgetfulness insomnia confusion depression lethargy pmt c craving pmt h hyperhydration craving for sweets weight gain increased appetite breast congestion and tenderness sugar ingestion causes abdominal bloating and tenderness one headache edema of the face and extremities two palpitations three fatigue or fainting pmt a is characterized by elevated blood estrogen levels and low progesterone levels during the luteal phase of a women s cycle pmt c is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of refined simple carbohydrates during the luteal phase of a women s cycle there is increased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose challenge the metabolic findings believed to be responsible for pmt c are a low magnesium and a low prostaglandin e one this condition of hypoglycemia is not unique to pms but there are a number of different causes of hypoglycemia magnesium and pge one seem to

three one two one three nine one nine eight zero treatment has traditionally involved progesterone administration if you can find a doctor who will treat you for pms just about as hard as finding one that will treat you for candida blooms while progesterone will work supplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better there really has been an awful lot of research done on pms much more than candida blooms many of these studies have been what are called experimental controlled studies the type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like to see done here are a few of these studies carbohydrate experimental controlled study effect of a low fat high carbohydrate diet on symptoms of cyclical mastopathy lancet two one two eight three two one nine eight eight two one pts with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy of at least five years duration were randomly selected to receive specific training to reduce dietary fat to one five of total calories and increase complex carbohydrate

supplementation was stopped most americans do not have a normal store of vitamin a in their liver these studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normal store of vitamin a into the liver could eliminate pms of all the vitamins given for pms vitamin a b six and vitamin e vitamin a has shown the best single effect this is probably because vitamin a is involved in steroid estrogen progesterone metabolism in the liver getting your liver full of vitamin a seems to be one of the best things that you can do to prevent the symptoms of pms but vitamin a is toxic and you don t want to be trying to do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for vitamin a toxicity vitamin b six experimental double blind crossoverr study pyridoxine vitamin b six and the premenstrual

questionnaire score of the cluster pain was significantly reduced during the second cycle month for the magnesium treatment group as well as the placebo group once they were switched to magnesium supplementation in addition the total score on the menstrual distress questionnaire was significantly decreased by magnesium supplementation the authors suggest that magnesium supplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes that occur during pms there are numerous observational studies that have been published in the medical literature which also suggest that pms is primarily a disorder that arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature but since observational studies are considered by most physicians in sci med to be anecdotal in nature i have not bothered to cite them there are also over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done on multivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent pms i ve chosen the best specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point out that pms is primarily a nutritional disorder but doctors don t recognize nutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathology beri beri pellagra scruvy etc pms is probably the best reason why every doctor being trained in the u s should get a good course on human nutrition pms is really only the tip if the iceberg when it comes to

while the drugs are undergoing early clinical testing dr edward scolnick president of the merck research laboratory in rahway n j arranged the collaboration he said that cooperation between companies seemed increasingly significant as it had become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more effective in fighting hiv than any drug used alone the researchers are hopeful that hiv when faced with a combination of several drugs requiring mutation at different sites for resistance to develop will be unable to evolve all the mutations at the same time therefore several drugs taken together or one after the other could halt the spread of hiv currently the drug companies do not know what other drugs their competitors are developing the new agreement allows companies to routinely exchange animal data and safety data on new aids drugs an agreement like this will greatly facilitate hicnet medical newsletter page three nine volume six number one one april two five one nine nine three companies ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a much more efficient way said scolnick he also said that the collaboration would not violate antitrust laws in creating the agreement merck spoke frequently to members of aids advocacy groups including act up dr daniel hoth director of the division on aids at the national institute of allergy and infectious disease

indicate that azt should not be administered in people with full blown aids writes columnist john maddox azt has been used in the united states in asymptomatic hiv positive people on the basis that administration of the drug appeared to abate the decline of t cell counts however a report in the lancet demonstrated that azt should not be used early in the course of disease while the cd four counts of the eight seven seven people given azt were consistently greater than those of patients receiving only placebo the first three years of follow up have shown that the proportions of people in the two groups progressing to overt aids or even to death were not significantly different at roughly one eight percent the conclusions are that azt is not an effective aids drug in hiv infected individuals and that cd four cell count may not be a reliable proxy for the progression to aids in infected people but nothing is implied by the study of the utility of azt in the treatment of those in whom symptoms have already appeared there is no case for abandoning that treatment at least on the evidence now available it is much more alarming that the cd four count has proven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in hiv infection aids researchers should acknowledge hiv is alive from the beginning of infection and turn it into a workable assay of the progress of disease the general application of such an assay will probably in itself provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of aids concludes maddox infective and anti infective properties of

percent two eight percent and four one percent and igm in six six percent seven eight percent and four one percent in children who survived longer than one eight months the risk of infection was associated with lack of persistence of igm and iga in their mothers milk the presence of hiv one infected cells in the milk one five days post partum was strongly predictive of hiv one infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis the combination of hiv one infected cells in breastmilk and a defective igm response was the strongest predictor of infection igm and iga anti

zero four two one nine three p seven a a total of fifteen u s and european pharmaceutical companies announced tuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early stage aids research to

 from bf four five five cleveland freenet edu bonita kale subject arthritis and diabetes organization case western reserve university cleveland ohio usa lines three seven reply to bf four five five cleveland freenet edu bonita kale nntp posting host slc four ins cwru edu i have osteoarthritis and my huband has just been diagnosed with diabetes type ii i guess no insulin i ve been trying to read up on these two conditions and what really surprises me is how few experiments have been done and how little is known losing weight appears to be imperative for diabetes and advisable for arthritis at least for women with arthritis but of course the very conditions that make weight loss advisable are part of the reason for the weight gain for myself i m almost afraid to lose weight because no matter how gentle and sensible a diet i use the last one was one eight zero zero two zero zero zero calories in about eight small meals the weight won t go off gradually and stay off instead it drops off precipitously and then comes back on with much interest like bread on the waters with this experience it s hard to be encouraging to my husband all i can suggest is to make it as gradual as possible meanwhile some experts recommend no sugar others no fat others just a balanced diet it s almost impossible to tell from their writings which parts of their recommendations are supposed to help the condition and which are merely ideas the expert thinks are nifty is it my imagination or are these very old conditions very poorly understood is it just that i m used to pediatrician talk it s strep give him this and he ll get well and so my expectations are too high bonita kale
 from antonio qualcom qualcomm com franklin antonio subject re thermoscan ear thermometer nntp posting host qualcom qualcomm com organization qualcomm inc san diego ca lines three nine in article ashwin cc gatech edu ashwin ram writes does the thermoscan instrument really work it is supposed to give you a fast and accurate temperature reading in the ear how far in the ear does one have to insert the instrument is it worth the one zero zero it is currently selling for no they do not work well my doctor started using one recently and i thought the concept was so amazing that i bought one too the thing works by reading the infrared emissions from the ear drum the ear drum is hotter than the ear canal walls so you have to point the thing very carefully this means tugging on the top of the ear to straighten out the ear canal then inserting the thing snugly then pushing a button unfortunately there are many things that can go wrong it is almost impossible to aim the thing correctly when you do it on yourself i get readings which differ from each other by up to two degrees and may differ from an oral thermometer by up to two degrees i talked to one of the nurses in my doctor s office recently about this and she said she didn t like them either for same reasons she did give me some instruction on how to tug on my ear and what correct insertion feels like but she said she thought it was impossible to do correctly on one s self she also said that she and other nurses had complained to the company about inaccurate readings and that someone from the company had told them to take great care to clean the infrared window at the end of the probe with alcohol from time to time she demonstrated this prior to reading my temperature and managed to get a reading within zero five degree of the oral temperature i took at home before driving to the dr s office i have also noticed tha some nurses click the button then remove the probe immediately this causes wrong readings in my experience you have to leave the probe in a good one to two seconds after clicking the button to get a good measurement the nurse i talked with agreed i suspect that many people don t realize this and therefore get bad readings for yet another reason in short it s a great idea it may work for some folks but i believe it doesn t work well for a person who wants to take his own temperature
