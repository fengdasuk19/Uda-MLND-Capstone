 from wdempsey athena mit edu wayne r dempsey subject computer equipment garage sale organization massachusetts institute of technology lines one two four distribution usa nntp posting host venus mit edu computer equipment garage sale i ve finally decided to clean out my closets and get rid of some of the stuff that is broken or not being used by me i ve put together a list and indicated what i think each item is worth this is just my estimate and i am very open to any offers including trades i m currently looking for some cd roms that will work with a mac cd rom player cd caddies hd floppy disks any used macintosh software a three eight seven three three mhz co processor or basically anything you have lying around cans of soup the neighbor s cat etc make me an offer no offer will be overlooked i really want to get rid of this stuff ok here s the list five two meg three five scsi hard drive conner model cp three one five zero i bought this from a guy at a swap meet to use with my macintosh unfortunately i can t seem to get it to work with the scsi controller in my computer the guy tested it with his pc and printed out a copy of the norton disk doctor report which says it has no bad sectors i ll send you a copy i was dumb enough not to get his phone number so i can t return it to him the drive has many jumpers on it which i don t know how to set so maybe that s the problem i was quite disappointed that it didn t work so i m trying to minimize my losses four five five two meg three five scsi hard drive conner model cp three one five zero same situation as above i bought both of these drives from the same guy despite the different model numbers they are the same exact drive same report from ndd i have one for each drive will be included four five four zero meg sony three five scsi hard drive sony model srd two zero four zero a the drive mechanism is completely trashed this hard drive was in my computer mac se and had a stiction problem well repeated banging on the side of the computer resulted in a head crash yes metal scraping metal which was not too pleasant to listen to still the scsi controller card is in good working order and can be used for parts or a project two zero six five meg seagate five two five hh scsi hard drive model st two seven seven n i originally bought this drive because it had a small stiction problem and i though that i could fix it well i determined that the drive mechanism was fine and that it was a controller problem motor controller wasn t sending proper signals well after taking the controller off the drive looking at it and putting it back together i realized that i accidentally severed one of the small flat cables that connect the drive to the controller i tried to solder it but i m not that good at soldering so i couldn t do it worked perfectly before i messed up i used it as a temporary drive when the sony above crashed on me also loaded the drive with about twenty mac applications worth well over one zero zero zero claris cad ms word five zero think c excel and many others i think all it needs is a resoldering of that cable you also get all the software on the drive if you can accept being a pirate i only ask that you delete my data files from the drive i was really angry when i broke that connection and then couldn t fix it i just don t have time to play with it any more six five at t isdn seven five zero zero modem this is for use on digital phone systems if you know what this is or would like technical information on it let me know i have some tech documents on it is supposed to be the same thing as an at t digital phone but without the phone part it seems to be in working order passes self test perfectly ok i have no idea how this is worth let me know if you re interested motorola six eight eight eight one coprocessor i haven t tested this one out yet but if anyone is interested i will get it tested out to make sure that it works i had trouble using it with my accelerator board but then i spoke to the manufacturer of the board and found out it couldn t be used without another controller chip when i was looking around to buy one new the prices were around one zero zero i will guarantee this to work six five cga card half length eight bit wasn t working last time i checked although i think i was using a bad monitor five five two five three six zero k floppy drive ibm drive type one three five five guaranteed to work because when i took it out of the pc it was working two five five two five three six zero k floppy drive toshiba model number nd zero eight de a guaranteed to work came out of same pc as above two five five two five floppy drives can t guarantee that these will work i don t even know if they are low or high density drives i don t have any method of testing them panasonic model number ju four five five five acg there s another number on it two six two six three six one seven two three panasonic model number ju four seven five two agg there s also another number on it h three six four nine one zero one four five seven toshiba model number nd zero eight de virtually identical to the one above each drive one zero three five ps two drive these things are proprietary so i can t test it but i think it works not sure if it s high density or low density but i suppose someone who is looking for one would know model number dfl four one three c zero four a i think these things are expensive to replace three five mfm hard drive controller cards i ve got three of these and i have no way of testing them two of them are eight bit cards and one is a sixteen bit card with a floppy controller built in one zero for the eight bits one five for the one six bit card w floppy interesting cable seems to convert from a vga plug to an ega plug that is standard nine pin to vga one five pin made by hewlett packard part no d one one eight one eight zero zero two zero one zero i ve sold stuff like this before and it was a huge success with many satisfied people trading or bartering stuff they didn t need anymore i usually ship through the u s postal service haven t had any problems yet and the shipping costs will be split or negotiated well that s all folks as i said before no offer will be refused if you can convince me to give ocit to you instead of throwing it out try i hate to throw away stuff wayne wdempsey athena mit edu six one
