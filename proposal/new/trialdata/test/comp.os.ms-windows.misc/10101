 from charlea eng clemson edu charles allen subject re question on eisa video board performance organization clemson university lines four four from article by cfw world std com christopher f wroten i have an eisa machine and i just do not understand why most eisa video cards only match the performance of their isa counterparts for instance the eisa orchid pro designer iis e is only about as fast as the isa diamond speedstar plus which isn t what i would call fast i don t understand why eisa video cards aren t as a group on the same level of performance as local bus cards given that eisa video cards have a three two bit bus to move data around instead of isa s eight bits good question answer the eisa bus does move three two bits rather than isa s eight one six but it still moves it at about the speed as the isa bus i think that s either eight or one zero mhz the local bus designs also move three two bits like the eisa but they move the data at the cpu speed up to four zero mhz so on a three three mhz cpu the local bus is moving three two bit data at three three mhz and the eisa is moving three two bit data at eight or one zero mhz so the local bus should be three to four times faster than eisa on a three three mhz cpu eisa should be about two maybe three times as fast as isa since they are not why would anyone me included pay a higher cost for a eisa video card when its performance is no better than and often worse that a much cheaper isa video board such as a diamond speedstar two four x from pc magazine s i think recent report i know that ati makes a pretty fast eisa video card but it s around five zero zero which is just about double what my wallet will allow me to spend and for five zero zero i could get a diamond viper and still have one zero zero left over of course i d have to get a local bus mother board too that s a very good question the eisa bus does have more advantages over the isa bus than just it s width for example more better interrupts and bus mastering but these other factors do not impact a video card very much they have more impact on file servers with multiple hard drives full throttle network cards cd roms etc can anyone shed some light on my confusion frustration thanks christopher wroten cfw world std com
