 from paladin world std com thomas g schlatter subject re smartdrv and dblspace organization the world public access unix brookline ma lines one six in article rcaldrn med miami edu richard calderon writes i just received a gateway four eight six three three with windows and dos six zero i ran it a few times with no apparent problems i decided to give double space a try after compressing the drive with no problems i decided to load windows it took one minute four five seconds to load after dblspace one seven seconds before dblspace i tinkered a little with the machine and noticed an error message saying smartdrive four zero cannot work with dblspace the reason for the change from smartdrv exe four zero included with windows three one to smartdrv exe four one included with dos six zero is compatability with dblspace be sure you are running smartdrv from your dos directory
