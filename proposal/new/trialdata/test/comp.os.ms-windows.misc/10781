 from relova unixg ubc ca michael a relova subject re winfax files in ascii format organization the university of british columbia lines two eight nntp posting host unixg ubc ca in zhao nmsu edu z zhao writes currently we are using winfax software to receive send fax on our pcs it works pretty well the problem is that all received files are in bit map format which take lots of hd space i have been told there is some programs that can do pattern recognition of the raster characters in fax in files and translate them into ascii code then store the file in ascii format would you like to tell me one whether or not there is such software package to do such translation two if there is one where can i find it three is any such software package on public domain what version of winfax do you have the newest version three zero has an ocr optical character recognition built in what this means is that it can take a fax ie a letter and convert it into ascii so that one can edit the document w o re typing it however i found that the ocr that comes packaged with winfax does not work as well as omnipage professional also by delrina software so once again winfax ver three zero has what you are looking for good luck regards zizi
