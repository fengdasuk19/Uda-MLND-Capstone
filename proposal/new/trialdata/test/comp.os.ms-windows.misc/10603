five five distribution world nntp posting host mishna esys cwru edu keywords control systems engineering mathematica public domain no fee release announcing cosy pak a symbolic control systems analysis package version zero nine no user fee release for mathematica version two zero or higher introduction cosy pak is set of packages and notebooks for classical control and some modern state space control analysis and design methods the notebooks in cosy pak follow a typical control engineering i course taught at many universities around the world for the junior senior level undergraduates there is no fee to use cosy pak but certain responsibilities are expected of the user see copyright notice in the readme file included below for starters e mail fax mail post the registration form included in the readme file cosy pak is available via anonymous ftp from mishna esys cwru edu internet no one two nine two two four zero two three in the pub directory p s a typical ftp session in unix is given after the readme file future releases if you would like to receive updates and newer versions of cosy pak please send e mail fax mail to the address below in addition your comments and suggestions are appreciated and are invaluable to us we will do our best to fix any reported bugs however we cannot fix those bugs that have not been reported to us and those we do not know of we would very much appreciate you taking a few minutes to communicate to us via e mail us mail telephone fax this will help us to release bug free versions in the future comments are welcome n

two four zero two three a sample ftp session is given at the end of this file changes in version zero nine update from v zero eight one to v zero nine in this version we have revised cosy pak to take advantage of the more robust signal processing functions available in mathematica v two one since mathematica two one provides a better and working laplacetransform and inverselaplacetransform functions than mathematica v two zero did we adopted them this has made cosy pak smaller thus brian evans signal processing packages that supported the laplacetransform and inverselaplacetransform functions in the cosy pak v zero eight one are no longer needed directly by cosy pak v zero nine for power users who use signal processing we still recommend the use of the very fine brian evans package on signal processing available at the anonymous ftp site gauss eedsp gatech edu or ip one three zero two zero seven two two six two four on the downside the disadvantage of this update can be that mathematica two one requires more runtime resources than its previous version for mathematica two zero users we have included the laplacetransform package from mathematica two one in the directory for two zero please move all files and directory under for two zero into the calculus directory under mathematica packages directory introduction this is an unsupported release of cosy pak a control systems analysis package for symbolic control systems analysis using mathematica two one classical control systems analysis and design methods and some modern control systems methods have been implemented in this package this package and the attendant notebooks were developed on a next tm computer a unix based workstation they have been used as a supplementary teaching aid along with standard control engineering texts ogata one nine nine one phillips and harbor one nine nine one for undergraduate courses in control engineering i taught at the systems engineering department of cwru in addition to the next they have also been tested successfully on apple macintosh computers tm and ibm pc s tm running ms windows tm we would be very much interested to hear from you if you or anybody you know uses this software on platforms not mentioned above ibm users however will have to evaluate the notebooks first to visualize the graphics once installed see below for instructions this collection of mathematica packages can be loaded by any user bundled with the packages are many notebooks cosy notes which demonstrate the functionality of these packages the notebooks follow a plan of many fine standard undergraduate control engineering text books listed in the references examples used in these notebooks have been collected from the various references given at the end of this file the contents of the notebooks in the cosy notes directory are given below begin cosy notes contents notebook file name zero one introduction ma chapter one introduction to control systems

path example for a unix machine default path join path example for an apple macintosh path join path example for ibm pc path join path change the pathname according to your machine by removing the mathematica comment sign and before and after path setting this command makes mathematica recognize the directory locallibrary mathematica packages on a unix machine my harddisk mathematica packages

documentation cosy pak functions are indexed in the files in the manual directory according the chapters usage is illustrated in notebooks residing in cosy notes directory if your computer does not support notebooks find a macintosh computer and acquire mathreader which is a public domain notebook reader mathreader will at least allow you to peruse notebooks but you will not be able to evaluate
