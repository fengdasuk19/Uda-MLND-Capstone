procedures write c fordham von reyn et al of the dartmouth hitchcock medical center in lebanon n h the researchers contacted two three one seven former patients on whom an hiv positive orthopedic surgeon performed invasive procedures between january one one nine seven eight and june three zero one nine nine two the orthopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after testing positive for hiv a total of one one seven four former patients underwent hiv testing representing five zero seven percent of patients on whom the orthopedic surgeon performed invasive procedures during the one three five year period patients were tested from each year and from each category of invasive procedure all patients were found to be negative for hiv by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay two former patients reported known hiv infection prior to surgery the examination of aids case registries and vital records neglected to detect cases of hiv infection among former surgical patients the estimated cost of the initial patient notification and testing was one five eight zero zero zero with the single most expensive activity being counseling and testing this accounted for three seven percent of the total expense the patient notification and testing were conducted while maintaining the confidentiality of the orthopedic surgeon who was an active participant in the planning and execution of the

one three one persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical procedures between one nine eight four and one nine nine zero and for whom the hiv positive surgeon was listed as the

were dead one one nine had no address four one three had test results known and four nine eight did not respond to the questionnaire no study patient name was found in reported aids case registries one newly detected hiv positive patient was determined to have been most probably infected in one nine eight five during a transfusion there was no hiv transmission in three six nine person hours of surgical exposure suggesting that hiv transmission to patients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per one zero zero zero person hours of surgical exposure the researchers determined there is no evidence to suggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard infection control guidelines over five zero percent of the patients with invasive procedures chose to be tested and of those whose results were revealed only one person was found to be infected with hiv the study patient s infection was probably the result of a tainted blood transfusion received in one nine eight five as a result there is no evidence that the transmission of hiv from the hiv positive surgeon to any patient transpired the researchers conclude april two zero one nine nine three drug concerns to share aids data new york times zero four two zero nine three p c one zero kolata gina a total of one five major pharmaceutical companies have decided in a highly unusual move to share aids drugs and information while the drugs are undergoing early clinical testing dr edward scolnick president of the merck research laboratory in rahway n j arranged the collaboration he said that cooperation between companies seemed increasingly significant as it had become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more effective in fighting hiv than any drug used alone the researchers are hopeful that hiv when faced with a combination of several drugs requiring mutation at different sites for resistance to develop will be unable to evolve all the mutations at the same time therefore several drugs taken together or one after the other could halt the spread of hiv currently the drug companies do not know what other drugs their competitors are developing the new agreement allows companies to routinely exchange animal data and safety data on new aids drugs an agreement like this will greatly facilitate hicnet medical newsletter page three nine volume six number one one april two five one nine nine three companies ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a much more efficient way said scolnick he also said that the collaboration would not violate antitrust laws in creating the agreement merck spoke frequently to members of aids advocacy groups including act up dr daniel hoth director of the division on aids at the national institute of allergy and infectious disease

indicate that azt should not be administered in people with full blown aids writes columnist john maddox azt has been used in the united states in asymptomatic hiv positive people on the basis that administration of the drug appeared to abate the decline of t cell counts however a report in the lancet demonstrated that azt should not be used early in the course of disease while the cd four counts of the eight seven seven people given azt were consistently greater than those of patients receiving only placebo the first three years of follow up have shown that the proportions of people in the two groups progressing to overt aids or even to death were not significantly different at roughly one eight percent the conclusions are that azt is not an effective aids drug in hiv infected individuals and that cd four cell count may not be a reliable proxy for the progression to aids in infected people but nothing is implied by the study of the utility of azt in the treatment of those in whom symptoms have already appeared there is no case for abandoning that treatment at least on the evidence now available it is much more alarming that the cd four count has proven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in hiv infection aids researchers should acknowledge hiv is alive from the beginning of infection and turn it into a workable assay of the progress of disease the general application of such an assay will probably in itself provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of aids concludes maddox infective and anti infective properties of

persistent immune response of the igm type in the mother s body fluids could be valuable to prevent transmission of hiv one from mother to child write philippe van de perre et al of the hicnet medical newsletter page four zero volume six number one one april two five one nine nine three national aids control program in kigali rwanda the researchers hypothesized that transmission of hiv one through breastmilk could be favored by the presence of infected cells by deficiency of anti infective substances in breastmilk or both factors a total of two one five hiv one infected women were enrolled at delivery in kigali rwanda milk samples were collected one five days six months and one eight months post partum hiv one igg secretory iga and igm were assayed by western blot for the latter two after removal of igg with protein g in the one five day and six month samples the researchers sought viral genome in milk cells by double polymerase chain reaction with three sets of primers gag pol and env at one five days six months and one eight months post partum hiv one specific igg was detected in nine five percent nine eight percent and nine seven percent of breastmilk samples iga in two three percent two eight percent and four one percent and igm in six six percent seven eight percent and four one percent in children who survived longer than one eight months the risk of infection was associated with lack of persistence of igm and iga in their mothers milk the presence of hiv one infected cells in the milk one five days post partum was strongly predictive of hiv one infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis the combination of hiv one infected cells in breastmilk and a defective igm response was the strongest predictor of infection igm and iga anti hiv one in breastmilk may protect against postnatal transmission of hiv the researchers conclude april two one one nine nine three firms to share aids research in global venture journal of commerce zero four two one nine three p seven a a total of fifteen u s and european pharmaceutical companies announced tuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early stage aids research to hasten the search for combination therapies to fight hiv infection and aids the companies said the unusual move resulted primarily from the increasing concentration of aids research on combination therapies since realizing that hiv is likely to develop resistance to every individual aids drug edward scolnick president of merck co research laboratories led the collaborative effort that took a year of negotiations to come together said participants in addition to merck the other companies involved in the inter company collaboration for aids drug development are bristol myers squibb co burroughs wellcome glaxo inc hoffman la roche eli lilly co pfizer inc smithkline beecham ab astra du pont merck syntex inc boehringer ingelheim miles inc and sigma tau the participants said that all companies involved in aids drug development they were aware of had joined the collaboration and that any company actively involved in hiv anti viral development may participate scolnick said the collaborators would most likely meet every couple of months for a daylong scientific meeting where they will review for one another their preclinical hicnet medical newsletter page four one volume six

reason for routine hiv testing among health care workers following recent highly publicized reports of health professionals who contracted hiv the department issued revised guidelines on the management of such cases dr kenneth calman chief medical officer said doctors dentists nurses and other health care workers have an ethical duty to seek advice if they have been exposed to hiv infection including if appropriate diagnostic hiv testing he said infected health care workers should not perform invasive procedures that carry even a remote risk of exposing patients to the virus
