two five cut here call for employers to keep information about the hiv status of health care workers confidential but doctors who know of an hiv positive colleague who has not sought advice must inform the employing authority and the appropriate professional regulatory body the guidelines also emphasize the significance of notifying all patients on whom an invasive procedure has been done by an infected health care worker a model letter to patients who have come into contact with such an individual is provided along with suggestions for health officials on how to deal with the media in addition a u k advisory panel on hiv infection in health care workers has been formed to provide specific occupational recommendations to those treating such patients properties of an hiv vaccine

envelope glycoprotein precursor from hiv one produced by microgenesys are advantages rather than disadvantages write franklin volvovitz and gale smith of microgenesys in meriden conn moore et al says that gp one six zero in a baculovirus expression system does not bind strongly to the cd four receptor and that this recombinant gp one six zero does not stimulate the same antibodies as the hiv one virus does in natural infection but vaccination with recombinant gp one six zero in patients infected with hiv one broadens hiv one specific envelope directed immune responses including crossreactive antibodies to gp one six zero epitopes and cd four and cd eight cytotoxic t cell responses volvovitz and smith claim that they never intended their gp one six zero molecule to be identical to the native protein antibody responses against native hiv one proteins including the types described by moore et al exist in nearly all aids patients but do not prevent hicnet medical newsletter page four two volume six number one one april two five one nine nine three progression of hiv disease in addition the binding of gp one two zero or gp one two zero antibody complexes to cd four has been shown to interfere with antigen specific activation of cd four cells and trigger programmed cell death in vitro which may contribute to the pathogenesis of hiv infection the absence of cd four binding by the microgenesys gp one six zero vaccine may therefore be viewed as an added safety feature phase i studies have demonstrated stable cd four counts stimulation of cytotoxic t cells and the suggestion of restoration of immune function based on these and other clinical results microgenesys gp one six zero was chosen by researchers at the karolinska institute in sweden for the first phase iii vaccine

mok jacqueline there are still more questions than answers regarding hiv one positive women breastfeeding their babies writes jacqueline mok of the lancet the anti infective properties of milk are

detectable levels lactoferrin and iga then increase from three to twelve months with nine zero percent of total iga in milk being secretory iga breastfeeding protects infants against gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses in both normal and uninfected children born to hiv positive mothers the italian national registry of aids discovered that breastfed hiv one infected children had a longer

antibodies against core antigens binding of hiv one to the cd four receptor can be inhibited by a human milk factor in the developing world where infectious disease and malnutrition contribute significantly to infant mortality breast milk is still the best food for infants regardless of the mother s hiv status transmission might be restricted by breastfeeding after colostrum and early milk have been expressed and discarded the possibility remains that breast milk could protect the infant who is already infected with hiv at birth and may even delay progression to aids concludes mok

dickinson gordon m et al if universal precautions are practiced the risk of hiv transmission from dentist to patient appears to be infinitesimal write gordon m dickinson hicnet medical newsletter page four three volume six number one one april two five one nine nine three et al of the university of miami school of medicine in miami fla the researchers contacted all patients treated by a dentist with aids and attempts were made to contact all patients for hiv testing living patients with newly detected hiv infection were interviewed and dna sequence analysis was performed to compare genetic relatedness of their hiv to that of the dentist death certificates were obtained for deceased patients and the medical records of those with diagnoses suggestive of hiv disease or drug abuse and those dying under the age of five zero years were examined in detail there were one one nine two patients who had undergone nine two six seven procedures of whom one two four were deceased an examination of the death certificates of patients identified five who had died with hiv infection all of whom were either homosexuals or iv drug users the researchers were able to detect nine six two of the remaining one zero four eight patients and nine zero zero agreed to be tested hiv infection was reported in five of the nine zero zero patients including four who had clear evidence of risk factors for the disease one patient who had only a single evaluation by the dentist denied high risk behavior comparative dna sequence analysis showed that the viruses from the dentists and these five patients were not closely related the study suggests the potential for hiv transmission from a general dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting in which universal precautions are strictly observed conclude dickinson et al april two two one nine nine three aids patients are susceptible to recurrences of tb study says washington post zero four two two nine three p a one three tuberculosis can strike aids patients more than once which makes the resurging health hazard harder to control according to a study published in today s new england journal of medicine people who contract tb usually develop an immunity that protects them if they are exposed to the bacteria again but a person whose immune system is depleted may not be able to fight off a new tb infection doctors found peter m small of the howard hughes medical institute at stanford university director of the study said that in order to protect against reinfection it may be necessary for some people to use tb medicines permanently the study examined the genetic makeup of tb bacteria and how the germs changed over time in one seven patients at kings county hospital in new york hiv one infection

no proof that hiv is the cause of aids the hypothesis that drug use leads to aids will hopefully become a hindrance to the physiologically azt and psychologically positive aids test toxic public health initiatives writes peter duesberg of the university of california berkeley in the lancet s march one three issue schechter et al call duesberg s hypothesis that injected and orally used recreational drugs and azt lead to aids a hindrance to public health initiatives however their hypothesis that hiv is the cause of aids has not attained any public health benefits the u s government spends four billion annually but no vaccine no therapy no prevention and no aids control have resulted from work on this hypothesis schechter et al conclude that hiv has a key role in cd four depletion and aids based on epidemiological correlations with antibodies against hiv and with self reported recreational drug use among homosexuals from vancouver however their survey neglects to disprove duesberg s drug aids hypothesis because it does not provide controls i e confirmed drug free aids cases and because it does not quantify drug use and ignores azt use altogether to refute duesberg s hypothesis schechter would have to produce a controlled study demonstrating that over a period of up to one zero years hiv positive patients who use recreational drugs or azt or both have the same aids risks as positives who do not do so the one zero year period is claimed by hicnet medical newsletter page four five volume six number one one april two five one nine nine three proponents of the hiv hypothesis to be the time needed for hiv to cause aids alternatively they could show that hiv free individuals who have used drugs for one zero years never get aids defining

vento sandro et al interferon ifn which induces autoantibodies and autoimmune diseases in some settings may hasten cd four t cell loss in some hiv one infected individuals through the amplification of harmful autoimmune reactions write sandro vento et al of the a pugliese hospital in catanzaro italy the researchers report three asymptomatic hiv one infected individuals with hepatitis c virus related chronic active hepatitis cah who had a rapid profound decline of cd four cells after ifn all three patients throughout the observation were consistently negative for serum hiv p two four antigen and had circulating antibodies to p two four sera from all three patients obtained at the end of ifn treatment and testing in enzyme linked immunosorbent assay contained high titres of antibodies reacting to a sequence located in the aminoterminal of the beta chain of all human hla class ii antigens homologous to a sequence located in the carboxy terminus of hiv one gp four one these autoantibodies which also recognize native class ii molecules and may contribute to the elimination of cd four t cells in vivo were at low tires five zero one zero zero in all three patients six months after stopping ifn such autoantibodies were not detected in two eight other patients with hiv infection and hcv related cah treated with ifn and who did not experience cd four t cell loss in some hiv one infected individuals through the amplification of harmful autoimmune reactions the subjects had a one b eight dr three and b three five dr one hla antigen combinations which are linked with a more rapid fall in cd four cell counts and clinical progression of hiv one disease ifn can induce a very rapid decline of cd four cells and should be used cautiously in patients with these hla haplotypes the researchers conclude april two three one nine nine three tb makes a comeback state government news zero four nine three vol three six no four p six voit william and knapp elaine s although tuberculosis was once believed to be eliminated in the united states it is emerging again among the homeless aids patients immigrants minorities and prisoners dr lee b reichman professor of medicine at the university of new jersey medical school and president of the american lung association said right now it s a big city problem but potentially it s everyone s problem the ala predicts that one zero million americans are infected with tb and about one zero percent of them will develop the disease because their immune systems are depressed especially those with aids or hiv gene hicnet medical newsletter page four six volume six number one one april two five one nine nine three tammes a centers for disease control expert said that is why the cdc has issued guidelines warning hospitals and institutions not to mix aids with tb patients state health officials believe the tb is also spreading because those who are most susceptible are the least likely to follow through with treatment in addition the increase is attributed to a shortage of public health services in new york city tb is an epidemic because the number of cases is increasing faster than we can treat people said dr george diferdinando director of the new york state tb control according to diferdinando curbing the spread of tb entails keeping eight five percent or more of diagnosed tb cases in treatment about four zero percent of infected new york city residents don t complete therapy when tb patients don t finish taking their medication multi drug resistant tb can develop which requires taking more expensive drugs and can take two years instead of the normal six months to treat increasing frequency of heterosexually transmitted aids in southern florida artifact or reality american journal of public health zero four nine three vol eight three no four p five seven one nwanyanwu okey c et al the alarmingly high rate of heterosexually acquired aids cases in southern florida was partially related to misclassification of risk write okey c nwanyanwu et al of the centers for disease control in atlanta ga the researchers investigated one six eight such aids cases from broward and coastal palm beach counties all of these cases attributed to heterosexual transmission reported sexual contact with bisexual men injecting drug users or persons born in countries where heterosexual contact is the primary route of hiv transmission medical records of patients in addition to records from social services hiv counseling and testing centers and sexually transmitted disease std clinics were reviewed if no other hiv risk factor was found from medical record review patients were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire once std clinic and other medical records were reviewed two nine men and seven women were reclassified into other hiv transmission categories after adjustments were made for the reclassification the percentage of aids cases reported from palm beach and broward counties between january one one nine eight nine and march three one one nine nine zero that was attributed to heterosexual transmission decreased from one zero percent to six percent among men and from three three percent to two eight percent among women while the percentage of heterosexually transmitted aids cases in southern florida decreased after adjustment was made for reclassified cases
