 from calzone athena mit edu subject legality of placebos organization massachusetts institute of technology lines two three distribution world nntp posting host w two zero five seven five two mit edu how is it that placebos are legal it would seem to me that if as a patient you purchase a drug you ve been prescribed and it s just sugar or whatever there s a few legal complications that arise one if you have been diagnosed with a condition and you aren t given accepted treatment for it it seems like intentional medical malpractice two a placebo should fall legally under the label of quackery why not three getting what you pay for deceptive bait and switch to an extreme false advertising what if mcdonalds didn t put one zero zero pure beef in their hamburgers so i m mystified are these assumptions erred if they aren t why the hell can a doctor knowingly or unknowingly prescribe a placebo thanks calzone
