 from joel cray com joel broude subject mevicore vs lopid vs nntp posting host equalizer organization cray research superservers inc san diego ca usa lines two six i used to be on lopid it did a good job of reducing cholesterol two nine five down to around two one four as well as ldl and triglycerides then i got pneumonia and for some reason the lopid stopped working very well cholesterol and triglycerides soared the levels might have stabilized over time but a new doctor had me quit wait a month then switch to mevicore on mevicore my total cholesterol was down to two zero seven ldl was one zero eight and hdl was three five but the trig s were still very high around three one eight and my liver tests came back slightly abnormal sgot eight three n one three five ggtp hard to read copy four two n zero three five he said the liver numbers were not offbase enough to cause him concern and the triglycerides are not as important as the cholesterol figures he had me stop the mevicore to allow the liver to heal just to be extra cautious though i m sure it s not a problem and wants me to go back on it after that i suggested maybe lopid might be the better choice and he said that he wouldn t object if that s what i want to do but lopid has one particular side effect i m not fond of should the above liver and trig figures be feared what happens to folks with high trig levels is my liver in danger with the above results would i be better off on lopid despite its inconvenient side effect or perhaps some other drug niacin affected my liver too
