 from houle nmt edu paul houle subject antihistamine for sleep aid article i d nmt one nine nine three apr two nine zero five two zero four four two three nine one eight organization electrical eng dept new mexico tech lines four six nntp posting host baltic for a very long time i ve had a problem with feeling really awful when i try to get up in the morning my sleep latency at night is also pretty long ranging from three zero min to an hour i get about seven hours of bedtime maybe six of actual sleep a night and more on the weekends i will spend two or three hours laying in bed after this if i can because i feel so tired when i wake up even more tired than i was when i went to bed which is usually too tired to work anyway i recently had a really bad flu so i called a friend to get me some cough syrup with both an expectorant and a nasal decongestant but he got vicks formula four four m which has everything but an expectorant so i used that anyway and the three nights i used it i fell asleep rapidly and felt that i got really good quality sleep that is i actually felt refreshed the next morning so i am now trying to look into both in the literature and experimentally the use of antihistamines as sleep aids since i am presuming that it was the antihistamine that caused the effect the antihistamine in vicks formula four four is chloriphenamine maleate so i bought some generic tablets of that and tried one last night and didn t notice any improvement i might try one with a little alcohol about one beer to see if it is a synergism effect also library research seems to show that benadryl is the antihistamine with the strongest sedative effect of what is availible otc so i might also buy a generic form of that and try that the pdr seems to suggest that five zero mg is a good dosage level to try for other medical information i have allergies but rarely have an allergic reaction living in new mexico i also have chronically dry eyes which get horrible if i try to use most underarm deoderants i did guess that my problem might be caused by hypoglycemia so i made some changes in my diet consistent with that and it didn t help so i went back to a normal diet pretty diverse also taking vitamin supplements anyway i am looking for advice for the use of antihistamines as sleep aids and if there are any dangers of such use seems safe to me since they are used chronically for allergies by millions i don t want to try bzs because bz addiction seems to be a serious threat and from what i hear bz sleep quality is not good whereas antihistamine sleep quality seems to be better for me i have tried some dietary tryptophan loading stuff and that also seems to lower sleep quality i seem to wake up around four zero zero or so and be in some kind of mental haze until seven zero zero or eight zero zero also i would be interested in any other advice for helping my problem although i ve already tried many of the non pharmacological solutions
