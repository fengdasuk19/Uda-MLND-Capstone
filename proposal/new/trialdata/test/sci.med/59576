 from mavmav mksol dseg ti com michael a vincze subject re chromium for weight loss nntp posting host localhost organization texas instruments lines one zero one in article writes there is no data to show chromium is effective in promoting weight loss the few studies that have been done using chromium have been very flawed and inher ently biased the investigators were making money from marketing it theoretically it really doesnt make sense either the claim is that chromium will increase muscle mass and decrease fat of course chromium is also used t o cure diabetes high blood pressure and increase muscle mass in athletes just as well as anabolic steroids sounds like snake oil for the one nine nine zero s where are your references i have been unable to find studies that state that chromium cures diabetese it can reduce the amount of insulin you have to take high blood pressure i have never heard of this claim before anabolic steroids i have also never heard of this claim before sounds like you are making things up and stretching the truth for god knows what reason did somebody piss you off at one time on the other hand it really cant hurt you anywhere but your wallet and place bo effects of anything can be pretty dramatic i agree with you that chromium picolinate by itself isn t likely to make a fat person thin but it can be the decisive component of an overall strategy for long term weight control and make an important contribution to good health it is important to exercise one one one two and also avoid fat calories nine one zero chromium picolinate has shown to reduce fat and increase lean muscle one two three i will not bore you with the statistics you wouldn t believe these anyway chromium picolinate is an exceptionally bioactive source of the essential mineral chromium chromium plays a vital role in sensitizing the body s tissues to the hormone insulin weight gain in the form of fat tends to impair sensitivity to insulin and thus in turn makes it harder to lose weight four insulin directly stimulates protein synthesis and retards protein breakdown in muscles five six this protein sparing effect of insulin tends to decline during low calorie diets as insulin levels decline which results in loss of muscle and organ tissue by sensitizing muscle to insulin chromium picolinate helps to preserve muscle in dieters so that they burn more fat and less muscle preservation of lean body mass has an important long term positive effect on metabolic rate helping dieters keep off the fat they ve lost chromium picolinate promotes efficient metabolism by aiding the thermogenic heat producing effects of insulin insulin levels serve as a rough index of the availability of food calories so it s not at all surprising that insulin stimulates metabolism four seven eight note that i did not say that chromium picolinate increases metabolism in summary you need to change your life style in order to loose weight and stay healthy a reduce dietary fat consumption to no more than two zero of calories eating fat makes you fat b increase dietary fiber low in calories high in nutrients c get regular aerobic exercise at least three times a week burn calories d take chromium picolinate daily lose fat keep muscle references one kaats gr fisher ja blum k abstract american aging association two one st annual meeting denver october one nine nine one two evans gw int j biosoc med res one nine eight nine one one one six three one eight zero three page tg ward tl southern ll j animal sci six nine suppl one abstract four zero three one nine nine one four felig p clin physiol one nine eight four four two six seven two seven three five kimball sr jefferson ls diabetes metab rev four seven seven three one nine eight eight six fukugawa nk minaher kl rowe jw et al j clin invest seven six two three zero six one nine eight five seven fehlmann m freychet p biol chem two five six seven four four nine one nine eight one eight pittman cs suda ak chambers jb jr ray gy metabolism two eight three three three one nine seven nine nine danforth e jr am j clin nutr four one one one three two one nine eight five one zero mccarty mf med hypoth two zero one eight three one nine eight six one one bielinski r schutz y jequier e am j clin nutr four two six nine one nine eight five one two young jc treadway jl balon tw garvas hp ruderman nb metabolism three five one zero four eight one nine eight six best regards michael vincze mav asd four seven zero dseg ti com
