 from ron roth rose com ron roth subject frequent nosebleeds x gated by usenet rosemail gateway v one seven zero organization rose media inc toronto ontario lines seven three a from some of the replies to my original posting it s evident that some a people do not secrete enough mucous to keep their nose lining protected include small amounts of hot spicy foods with your meals it s not a cure but many people find it helpful to create extra mucus you may also consider taking a few drops of iodine in juice or water consult your doctor first which is available otc in canada if you have a sedentary lifestyle exercising sometimes helps a from environmental influences ie dry air but i ve had no responses a from anyone with experience with rutin is there another newsgroup that a might have specifics on herbal remedies a a robert allison i tried to e mail you but our board is having internet problems so i m not sure whether you got the information on rutin or not rutin is not a herb but part of the bioflavonoid complex you should generally not take rutin by itself but take the whole bioflavonoid complex instead if you don t and there are some exceptions to that you ll eventually create a hesperidin deficiency which is the other major component of the bioflavonoid complex i found out the hard way years ago when i recommended rutin after it showed deficient in patients who were not deficient in hesperidin be fore a later retest almost always showed a subsequent deficiency in hesperidin which from then on made me always add bioflavonoids to anyone that had very low levels of rutin most of the time people are equally low in rutin and hesperidin so there is really no reason to take rutin by itself but use the whole bioflavonoid complex instead i have several thousand patients taking them with many claiming that they had been helped with hemorrhoids varicose veins chronic nose bleeds aneurysms gastro intestinal bleeding due to drugs etc one patient in desperation took a whole bottle one zero zero s in one day for his painful bleeding hemorrhoids without any ill effects they are also non toxic in very high amounts that s why they can be safely recommended if you are allergic to citrus fruit they are made from their peels pine bark sources are available as well about nine zero of patients tested show a bioflavonoid deficiency with the average daily dosage needed being about one two zero zero zero mg for major complaints four six zero zero zero mg day is common in case they cannot be taken because of their size and taste they are big and they don t taste that great a product made from pine bark extract gives you the same effect and the tablets are quite small and taste much better however the cost is about seven times higher for the equivalent effect one two five mg tablet of the pine bark extract gives you about the same effect as one zero zero zero mg of bioflavonoids the name for the pine bark product is pycnogenol some canadian brands carrying bioflavonoids are quest one zero zero zero mg big bitter not chewable swiss herbal six zero zero mg smooth easier swallowing jamieson five zero zero mg medium bitter chewable sisu two five mg pycnogenol small easy swallowing give them a try and see what happens and good luck ron roth internet rn three two two eight rose com rosenet ron roth rosehamilton eating radium has strange results tom said brightly rosereader two one zero p zero zero three two two eight entered at rosehamilton rosemail two one zero usenet rose media hamilton four one six five seven five five three six three
