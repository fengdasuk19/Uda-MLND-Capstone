 organization arizona state university from subject re opinions on allergy hay fever shots lines two two in article jacquier gsbux one uchicago edu eric jacquier says from now on it looks like two shots per week for six months followed by one shot per month or so each shot costs two zero talking about soaring costs and the health care system i would call that a racket we are not talking about rare amazonian grasses here but the garbage which grows behind the doctor s office apart from this issue i was somewhat disappointed to find out that you have to keep getting the shots forever is that right you might look for an allergy doctor in your area who uses sublingual drops instead of shots for treatment you are given a small bottle of antigens three drops are placed under the tongue for five minutes my allergy to bermuda grass was neutralized this way throughout the treatment process i had to return to the doctor s office every month for re testing and a new bottle of antigens after the allergy was completely neutralized a bottle of maintenance antigens lasts me about four months the sublingual drops are then taken three times per week and costs two zero so the cost is less than shots and it is more convenient just to take the drops at home bruce long
