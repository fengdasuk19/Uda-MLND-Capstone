 from banschbach vms ocom okstate edu subject re vitamin a and hearing loss lines two four nntp posting host vms ocom okstate edu organization osu college of osteopathic medicine distribution sci in article claude banana fedex com claude bowie writes i heard a news report indicating research showing improved hearing in people taking vitamin a the research showed that new growth replaced damaged hairlike nerves has anyone heard about this claude i ve not heard or read anything that would suggest that vitamin a retinol could reverse hearing loss due to nerve damage usually caused by high sound levels but also occassionally due to severe infection the types of cells that vitamin a regulates are the general epithelial cells and these cell types are not the ones that function in the ear hearing process the hair cell nerve like epithelial cells in the ear may respond to vitamin a during cellular differentiation embryogenesis but i don t know if they are still capable of responding in adults if they are capable of responding with new hair growth this would be a very major breakthrough in hearing loss with all of the medical interest in vitamin a it would not be too surprising if a clinical study was done using vitamin a to reverse hearing loss but with only a news announcement to go on and this type of communication is notoriously bad i can t comment on your question anymore than i already have if one study has been done more will need to follow to firm up a link between vitamin a and hearing loss if there really is one marty b
