 from twain carson u washington edu barbara hlavin subject re schatzki ring pvc s organization university of washington seattle lines four two nntp posting host carson u washington edu in article uabdpo dpo uab edu gila zero zero five stephen holland writes in article ohandley betsy gsfc nasa gov wrote the second issue summarized he has had extra heartbeats for the past three to four years and once was symptomatic from them with some lightheadedness he is young three zero ish thin and in good health recent bloodtests were all normal and do not smoke use drugs or caffeine etc i m willing to accept the extra beats as normal but don t want to ignore them if they might be some kind of warning symptom the number of pvc s seems to increase throughout the day and with exercise or something as simple as climbing some stairs also if i get up after sitting or lying down for a while i tend to get a couple of extra beats could they possibly be related to the esophagous problems both seemed to develop at about the same time i not an expert on heart problems but pvc s are common and have been overtreated in the past my personal experience and i have the same history an build you do related to the heart that is is that my pvc s come and go with some months causing anxiety taking on more fluids seems to help and they seem worse in the summer remember that a slow heart rate will allow more pvc s to be apparent so perhaps it is an indication of a healthy cardiac system but ask an expert about that last point especially i too have had premature ventricular heartbeat starting in one nine seven four these are not by the way extra heartbeats this is how they feel and this is how i described them initially to the doctor but they re actually premature heartbeats i would sometimes experience a lapse after one of these that went on for a suffocatingly long period of time making me wonder if my heart were ever going to beat again i had them persistently for eighteen years then i went on a low fat diet and they just stopped i haven t had a single episode of pvh for almost two years i know correlation does not imply causation this is just fwiw barbara
