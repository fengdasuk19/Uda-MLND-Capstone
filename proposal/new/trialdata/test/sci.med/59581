 from sdb ssr com scott ballantyne subject re burzynski s antineoplastons in reply to jschwimmer wccnet wcc wesleyan edu s message of two zero apr nine three two two one six two four est lines four four organization scotsoft research in article jschwimmer wccnet wcc wesleyan edu josh schwimmer writes any opinions on burzynski s antineoplastons or information about the current status of his research would be appreciated burzynski s work is not too promising none of his a one through a five antineoplastons have been shown to have antineoplastic effects against experimental cancer the nci conducted tests of a two and a five against leukemia in mice with the result that doses high enough to produce toxic effects in the mice were not effective in inhibiting the growth of the tumor or killing it these were in one nine eight three and one nine eight five burzynski claims that a one zero is the active factor common to all of a one and a five something which he has not shown a one zero has only been extracted from a two he also hasn t shown that a one through a five are actually distinct substances the nci conducted a series of tests using a one zero against a standard panel of tumors that included different cell lines from tumors in the following classes leukemia non small cell and small cell lung cancer colon cancer cancer of the central nervous system melanoma ovarian cancer and renal cancer a one zero exhibited neither growth inhibition nor cytotoxicity at the dose levels tested it is necessary to process a one zero since it is not soluble burzynski s theory requires soluble agents but this basically hydrolizes it to pag which he calls as two five pag is not an information carrying peptide something which byrzynski claims is necessary for antineoplastic activity as two one also derived from a one zero is a four one mixture of pa and pag pa also not a peptide can be purchased at a chemical supply houses for about zero zero nine a gram a one zero is chemically extremely similar to glutithamide and thalidomide both of which are habit forming and can cause peripheral neuropathy the nasty effects of thalidomide are widely known in spite of this similarity a one zero does not appear to have been tested for it s potential to induce teratogenicity or peripheral neuropathy many of burzynski s statements about the origin of his theory early research past and present support by others for his work have been shown to be untrue sdb sdb ssr com
