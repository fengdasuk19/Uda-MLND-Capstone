 from oecjtb oec four orbital dialix oz au john bongiovanni subject summary borland microsoft database c libraries organization orbital engine company lines three eight four well i m amazed at how successful this exercise was i received two zero responses and four requests for summary thanks to everyone who made it possible on my own i was able to find out about codebase accsys and q e codebase and accsys are c libraries without sql q e is a windows application that can be communicated through windows dde calls where you send a sql string and receive the results most people wrote to tell me about the paradox engine from borland other products mentioned were microsoft s odbc accsys quadbase codebase rbase and q e only odbc quadbase rbase and q e have sql for myself i decided on codebase mostly because it has an ansi c portability version that runs under dos unix etc and includes the source code and portability is important in my application it works with dbase foxpro or clipper files however i feel that microsoft s odbc looks very promising it s mostly a formalisation of building and submitting sql queries and formatting query results as the responses say it s available via ftp except it s effectively unusuable without two manuals the odbc programmer s reference and the odbc sdk guide moreover odbc doesn t actually interpret sql and liase with databases that s up to drivers that should be provided by database manufacturers also it s windows only it s actually an extension to the windows sdk nevertheless it s a start at a sql interface standard and should make life interesting in the future here s my original post followed by the responses separated by a line of asterisks does anyone know if borland or microsoft have libraries for accessing their respective databases paradox foxpro from within c programs i d really like to be able to build a sql query string and pass it to a function which returns the query results in some format failing that any other access would still be better than nothing i d also like to hear of third party libraries for doing the same thing if other people are interested i ll prepare a summary of what i m told and post it thanks to all borland has a product called paradox engine that does just what you want the current version is three zero which is fully compatible with ack paradox four zero why the versions are different i don t know pd engine two zero was compatible with pdox three zero and three five it consists of a rather broad library of functions for accesing database files from both pascal i think turbo pascal five five and up and c i think either microsoft or borland now reading the box it s borland paradox engine it s big i believe one eight mb but worth downloading over a fast link look at ftp uu net in vendor microsoft odbc sdk also some companies are starting to provide sql engines i just got one for rbase not exactly cheap at four five zero but it allows programs in c or vbasic under dos or windows to talk to data bases using sql functions in your code hth walter knopf fermilab knopf fnal fnal gov check out the odbc toolikt from microsoft it is available on ftp uu net vendor microsoft odbc sdk this is the way that we ve chosen to access databases from all of our apps mj ppppp sssssiiiiii specialists in ms windows and windows nt development pp ppss ii call for information

holmes ave so five minneapolis mn five five four zero eight borland sells the paradox engine which is a c language interface to paradox dbase btrieve ans asci files they also sell database frameworks which includes the engine plus a collection with source of c classes for using the engine earl roethke eroethke ems cdc com i actualy have paradox engine it is a library of functions large model for accessing the paradox s databases it seems to be working fine but i never did try it thouroughly it costs two zero zero hope it will help you from david lefebvre borland provides a database lib called paradox engine which can access and use the database files aswell as many other things gary bell nellads cc monash edu au gary bell department of robotics and digital technology faculty of computing caulfield campus monash university australia paradox engine is the library for paradox artur babecki artur ii uj edu pl borland sells the paradox engine which has all the paradox calls in it its hardly sql though you can do searches on key fields and on indivual fields but no comparison operators like so its pretty painful in my opinion do do anything besides simple retrieval and inserts updates i m currently using it i have an eval copy and i ve linked it in to some entry screens i ve written the engine library adds about one zero zero k to the size of the program but you can load it as an overlay using borland s vroom manager now borland claims that later versions of the engine will have sql support but they don t really expect it till late in the year or even next year they are trying to get thrid parties to help out if you have any other questions let me know mike kamlet mike vpnet chi il us yes borland sells their paradox engine separately it has c c and pascal interfaces although the underlying interface is in c well at least for version two zero of the engine which i have costed nine nine at egghead they now have version three zero of the engine and a separate c class package for it michael d kersenbrock adc kentrox portland oregon michaelk kentrox com uunet kentrox michaelk i ve used accsys for paradox new version is almost ready for paradox four zero to access paradox files from c its pretty good not sql though have heard of borland paradox engine or some such which is supposed to do likewise but not sure of what it is exactly hope this helps good luck chris from fernand slinky cs nyu edu christopher fernandes borland sells their paradox engine three zero it s a library of functions for accessing paradox db files it comes with libraries for ms c seven zero bcc three one turbo pascal v and i believe it comes with turbo pascal win libraries as well the c libraries come in both dos and windows flavors the win stuff being dll s when i got it it also came with crystal reports which is a graphical report generator it allows you to create a generic form and use it within a compiled program using pdox engine i don t know if they still offer it or what the current price is i paid something like five zero six zero for an upgrade from the earlier version though hope this helps david taylor the commander it is easier to change the internet gt two eight four seven c prism gatech edu specification to fit the program also dtaylor cfd gatech edu than vice versa and root cfd gatech edu author unknown but very wise if you want to do sql from within your programs check out quadbase i don t have their address oops yes i do quadbase systems inc seven nine zero lucerne dr five one sunnyvale ca nine four zero eight six usa phone four zero eight seven three eight six nine eight nine voice four zero eight seven three eight six nine eight zero fax ask for the sql win demo disk it looked good to me i have a background in embedded sql in ingres this looked real similar it s a little expensive but if you order the demo and then just wait they will probably send you a special offer that ll probably run about five zero zero us good luck best tom delosh from delosh emunix emich edu tom delosh borland has the paradox engine library it has libraries for both c and pascal to access paradox files under dos windows but for paradox i believe you d have buy have the sql link since pdox itself isn t sql compliant i ve used the engine for over a year now and have been pretty satisfied with it under dos it s a real pig it tacks on about one two zero k to the size of your programs tim ma associate programmer university of utah email tim src cppa utah edu i don t know about microsoft but borland sells the paradox engine for c c i may be able to point you in the right direction from raymond cruzio santa cruz ca us raymond borland has a paradox engine and database framework three zero which gives you a c and assembler api to paradox databases this is part of boca borland s object component architecture they have technical briefs on boca pdoxeng and other products of theirs from jdm jumbo read tasc com james d mcnamara
