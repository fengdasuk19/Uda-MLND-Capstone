 from mpalmer encore com mike palmer subject re windows on a ramdrive help organization encore computer corporation nntp posting host sysgem one encore com lines three one f langleyrh ccsvax sfasu edu writes stuff del d for bandwidth s sake why sigh if you don t have more than one six mbs of memory using a ramdrive with windows is a waste of memory windows will access upto one six mb ram better as memory as to why what you did didn t work it is because driveletters and paths are stored inside the group pif ini files all of the sudden things went from drive c to drive e however if you wanted to copy an application up to the ramdrive and re setup it up that should work normally but as previously stated this will only hurt things unless you ve got more than one six mbs of ram and are using whats above one six as the ramdrive i personally have two zero mb s of ram and run a four mb ramdrive with a great deal of success however if you are looking to speed up windows the three things i ve noted that work the best are one a graphics accellerator card two a co processor even an emulator helps three some other disk cache besides smartdrive i ve tried several and lightning for windows and norton cache give me major headaches as well i think the purpose the original poster was trying to serve is to avoid the significant amount of disk access that windows does on startup it s like it s trying to it s bit in wearing the damn drive out i estimate it s only reading a mb of programs data but from the performance the drive gives it sounds like they are scattered all over the drive my drive is however regularily compressed what is it that takes so much fuss perhaps if ms would take the trouble to optimize this startup process less people would be wanting to find a solution themselves
