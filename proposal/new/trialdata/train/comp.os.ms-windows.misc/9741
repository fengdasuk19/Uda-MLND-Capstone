 from aew eosvcr wimsey bc ca alan walford subject summary ati graphics ultra questions etc reply to aew eosvcr wimsey bc ca organization eos systems inc vancouver b c canada lines one four seven to those interested in the new ati ultra cards i had posted some questions regarding the new ati ultra pro cards and had asked confirmation of some opinions this message is a summary of the responses thanks to all of you that replied one the card does not work in a system with three two m ram a the higher memory limits apply to isa cards only as far as i know the vlb and eisa version should have no problems b i m pretty sure from my experience that the isa version doesn t work in systems with over one six m ram there is supposed to be way of switching the memory aperture feature off to prevent this but apparently it doesn t work i posted some help me messages on the net and people indicated that the eisa card didn t have this problem c false d the vlb card which i have allows you to set memory aperture over three two m by using their configuration software no messing with jumpers necessary the three two m problem is probably valid only for isa cards two the card works in a three two m system with some switches set but it is much slower a again the memory aperture need only be disabled if you have more than one two four m ram eisa and vlb or one two m isa three two m should not be a problem for you b dunno c depends on the bus yes if isa no if eisa or localbus three the card is interlaced in its two four bit true colour modes a nope i can use six four zero x four eight zero at seven two hz two four bit and eight zero zero x six zero zero at seven zero hz two four bit all non interlaced b yes according to pc magazine they ve tested a local bus version that does one zero two four x seven six eight in two four bit which may or may not be interlaced c not for the pro sometimes for the plus some modes may run only interlaced on certain monitors this has nothing to do with two four bits only with screen size note that for two four bit color and windows you must have two megs memory size calculations notwithstanding four the latest build five nine drivers still do not work in many cases a they aren t perfect but are much improved i don t recall the last time which i had to leave mach three two mode ati gup mode and switch to eight five one four or vga mode due to software incompatibility b true many people recommended going back to build five five or five four c they appear to be excellent but have a few bugs for example certain graphs with dashed lines in mathcad three one do not print correctly though they do display ok on the screen they are about par for fancy cards other accelerated cards also have bugs d overall i like the card even if driver performance is somewhat less than satisfactory i am running the one zero two four seven six eight one six color mode as that is all my nt driver for october nt version seems to allow i will say this that color performance is not quite as nice as a diamond stealth vram but i have not been able to try out a lot of the options on the old driver five this card is the fastest full colour card for the money a it s quite fast but whether or not its the fastest is open to debate b yes i ll admit it was very very fast in one six bit mode which is what i wanted to use it for too bad it crashed in many different ways every two zero minutes or so c depends on many many things six this card is the greatest thing since sliced bread a i like it b well pc magazine seems to think it is c yes this appears to be true d as to greatest thing since sliced bread i doubt it better cards are coming out who knows maybe ati will come out with something faster yet several reviews i read rated one pycon winjet card as a superior performer at a cheaper price except for availability of drivers which pycon was developing at that time pc magazine about two months or so back overall the card has a lot of potential but you have to be able to use it that is the end of the questions these were the most discussed items in this group so i thought they needed confirmation for those of you not familiar with the card i have included a summary here from an ati ad since i don t have an graphics ultra yet ati graphics ultra plus accelerated one zero two four x seven six eight at six five k colours true colour one six seven m at eight zero zero x six zero zero multimedia video acceleration for indeo video rle and video one compressed stretch full motion video windows to full size fast vga includes three button mouse isa versions only anti aliased fonts ed avail in one six colour mode only i think real time pan and zoom across large virtual windows desktop around a one two length card size priced from four zero zero u s ati graphics ultra pro everything in graphics ultra plus faster performance with vrams accelerated one two eight zero x one zero two four at two five six colours seven four hz non interlaced available in isa eisa and microchannel priced from six zero zero u s ati technologies four one six seven five six zero seven one eight i hope this summary can be of use to you al p s i am not associated with ati technologies in any way other than having used their previous ati ultra card for a few years which i generally liked alan walford eos systems inc vancouver b c
