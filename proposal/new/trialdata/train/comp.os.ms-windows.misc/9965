 from dpiaseck jarthur claremont edu derek a piasecki subject re ami pro three zero and pctools compress doesn t like being moved keywords ami pro three zero pctools compress organization harvey mudd college claremont ca nine one seven one one lines one three sorry about that don t want to alarm anyone i don t think there is any correlation between the crashes and pctools i reinstalled ami pro and ran compress again with no problems i think problems may have been related to filling my disk until it had zero bytes left while ftping although i would think it wouldn t matter since ami pro wasn t running at the time and i made space available immediately anyways but whatever the cause it is working now derek
