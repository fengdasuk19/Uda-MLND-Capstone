 from subject re quicken six vs tobias managing your money organization purdue university lines two seven in article q twg com michael wiesenberg wrote i just got a copy of tobias managing your money v nine zero i have quicken six and it s wonderful for some things but mym seems to have some features that q six doesn t for example q six doesn t seem to be able to handle monthly automatic deductions from a checking account you know a monthly payment that gets electronically deducted every month from my checking account or is there something that i m not doing right and q six can actually do that hi i have never used mym so i can not help you with the comparison of the two products i am however a devoted quicken user and i can tell you how to set up the weekly monthly quarterly yearly transactions first use the memorize feature ctrl m to record the recurring transactions next define a transaction group which uses these memorized transactions and specify the frequency that it should be used i e monthly quicken will can not automatically make the transactions for you but now all you do is recall the group and all of the individual transactions will be entered at once additionally if you are using the bill minder it will remind you when each transaction group is due for example you could have three transaction groups one for payments at the beginning of the month middle of the month and one for quarterly payments i hope this helps mike
