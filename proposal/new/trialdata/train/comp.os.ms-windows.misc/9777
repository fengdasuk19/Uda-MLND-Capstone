 from jamie zikzak apana org au jamie scuglia subject workspace manager for win three one organization zikzak public access unix melbourne australia lines eight nntp posting host zikzak apana org au are there any workspace managers out there for windows three one by a workspace manager i mean something like the hp apollo workstations have multiple workspaces under x there is a window at the bottom of the screen which allows you to select different workspaces it overcomes the problem of having stacks of windows open on the one screen instead you can spread them amongst different workspaces which act like independent screens and you can flick between them thanks in advance
