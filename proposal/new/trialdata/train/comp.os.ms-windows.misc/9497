 from adriene nazaretian qm yale edu aln go ny giants subject re re win nt what is it nntp posting host gorgon cis yale edu organization yale university new haven connecticut usa lines seven two in article rmohns vax clarku edu says in a previous article alanchem csd four csd uwm edu alan scott olson wrote two part question one what is windows nt a real windows os two this past weekend a local hacker radio show metioned a new product from microsoft called chicago if i recall anyone know what this is that is it thanks a heap alan windows nt is a giant windows operating system unline win three one it does not run on top of dos it is its own os with billy gates assures us true multi tasking multithreading meets dod security specs will run win three one programs as well as dos programs has multi processor support and is primarily a server program it s overhead is too high for it to be economical for most users it also runs os two character based apps and posix apps the dos one six bit and three two bit windows apps run in a windows three two bit subsystem if you consider the fact that nt has the lanman redirectors built in support for tcp ip built in support for netbeui comes with tcp utils like ping and an ftp client etc applications like schedule and a three two bit version of msmail the storage argument isnt an issue speaking of overhead it requires at least a three eight six with one six megs of ram it iwll run with one two but that s like running os two two zero with four megs and that s just to run it also i have heard that the system files take up three zero five zero megs and it is recommended that your drive be a half gig the skd is distributed on cd rom i ran it on a four eight six with eight mram and it did a ton of disk swapping with a one nine m virtual memory paging file it functioned but it crawled this was the oct build i upgraded the machine to one six m and the performance is good at that point i installed the march build consider they are probably still working on the feature set and havent done a lot of fine tuning to the code yet chicogo is what i want to use it is like nt a true os with thrue multitasking and multithreading but has much smaller hardware requirements and does not meet dod security specs but that s okay since it will probably be more of a client os there are a few otehr differences but those are the main ones there was an article about chicogo in pc week last august the chicogo and nt development groups at micro oft are in intense competition so it is said however i think a different relationship will arise nt will be the server n etowrk t echonology chicogo will be the client machine it is entirely possible for different os s to work together partly because chicogo is just a small nt think of it that way anyway novell netware creates an os on the server that is truly not dos so don t scorn the concept anyway don t expect it soon windows four and dos seven are supposed to be released next year read see it in nine five so i expect that chicogo won t be out til nine six i have little info on chicago so i cant make a comparison is it in beta is there anyone out there who has tested both and cares to make a comparison just my zero zero two aln
