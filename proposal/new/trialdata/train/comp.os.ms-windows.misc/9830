 from kaul watson ibm com subject dmqs files for xga two was re catseye x xga two extra modes news software ibm os two pm rn nr two v zero one seven h by o vishnepolsky and r rogers lines five five seven reply to kaul vnet ibm com disclaimer this posting represents the poster s views not necessarily those of ibm nntp posting host kaul bocaraton ibm com organization ibm t j watson research note the followups are set to comp os os two misc dmqs files describe monitors and valid modes to be used by the xga two under both windows and os two these files are unsupported ibm has nothing to do with these files or this post it s personal this time and every time i post see the signature due to demand and requests here are some additional dmqs files i ve collected for the xga two these files function with the latest revision of the drivers for the xga two not all these files will work under windows with the drivers available to the general public at this time all files will function under the most recent os two two one beta and those i ve tried have worked under os two two zero sp not all files have been fully tested these files are unsupported they represent a personal collection not anything resembling an officially supported set as a standard disclaimer i would like to point out the following facts one some of these files may run your adapter out of spec doing so can stress the ics on the card and may result in incorrect operation or in shorter life how short depends on how much out of spec boom two some of these files may run your adapter in a region that is out of spec for your monitor resulting in damage to your monitor three you should be knowledgable about your monitor and adapter s ability to use the mode you select using these files represents hacking in a very true sense so practice safe computing and don t play around too much if you don t like the risks and aren t knowledgable about what you re doing four if you feel uncomfortable with all the warnings use the dmqs files you have or wait until ibm releases official tested dmqs files although you should be aware of warning two even with the ibm files these files are unsupported by using them you may invalidate your warrenty not all have been fully tested i don t have that many monitors installation unpack in your dmqspath environment variable usually c xga dmqs then use the methods described in your xga two installation diskette to change your adapter or settings packing these files have been packed with the latest infozip utility you will need pkzip two x if you don t have the infozip utilities submitting feel free to send me uuencoded versions of your favorite dmqs files for your favorite monitors i m always interested in collecting more archive these files have been uploaded to
