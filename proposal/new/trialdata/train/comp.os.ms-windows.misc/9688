 subject re gatewaying microsoft mail workgroups via nine six from wesj extsparc usu edu wes james reply to wesj extsparc usu edu distribution world organization sun microsystems inc nntp posting host extsparc agsci usu edu lines four zero we here at utah state university cooperative extension have been using w four wg for a while now we wanted to talk to the internet with the mail package so we got the smtp gateway you also need a tcp ip transport package on top of that which is utterly stupid but that s what they require to get the smtp gateway to work you need a dedicated pc for the gateway and if you are looking at remote access you need another dedicated pc for the remote mail stuff we do not have the remote mail going but you indicate that that is what you want to do there is a glitch somewhere in the system though i don t know if it is ms mail the gateway or the vax here on campus that is choking in the mail that is sent the scenario is this the outgoing mail goes to a unix system which then routes the mail where it needs to go if that mail is routed to the vax the vax has problems some times receiving the mail most messages do get through this way except if someone has there mail on the vax forwarded to some other location that is the main gotcha where ever the mail is forwarded to that person gets a message header then a message saying boudary error garbage code stuff if you can stay away from sending to a vax you are ok the system people of course say that the vax is not the problem the gateway is probably the problem if anyone wants to get help it is only one seven five zero zero for one support call until problem is worked out phooey to that i say i am looking vigorously for a better idea if you go forward on any of this and find out anything knew please drop me a note anyone the next itteration is supposed to have tcp ip built in they say the netxt itteration of w four wg good luck wes james email wesj extsparc agsci usu edu utah state university cooperative extension systems specialist umc four nine zero zero voice eight zero one seven five zero two two two nine logan ut eight four three two two four nine zero zero fax eight zero one seven five zero three two six eight
