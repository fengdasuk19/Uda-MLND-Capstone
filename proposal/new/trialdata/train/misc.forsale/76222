 from andy sail stanford edu andy freeman subject re is itproper net etiquette to advertise a company s junk mail list organization computer science department stanford university distribution usa lines four two in article thomper leland stanford edu dale buford thompson writes my company maintains a two zero zero zero zero mailing list which is regularly rented for oh no someone is provided useful information and mentioned that they made money in the field don t they know that usenet is reserved for uninformed speculation by people trying to sell their personal stuff from houses to dead pcs at a huge markup trying to unload stuff they bought from their company at just under retail and other non commercial activities a ms windows utility product in the one zero zero range and is available through direct media in ct at zero one zero per name please let your direct mail marketing rep know about this thanks it is my impression that net etiquette does not allow companies to use the net to directly advertise their products the net is not supposed to be a dumping ground for free ads but reserving it for tripe doesn t seem to be a significant improvement in addition to improper etiquette this product is a mailing list used for generating junk mail so either they target it well enough to pay for it in other words they manage to send it to people who want the stuff in which case it is junk only for the rest and the transaction costs are borne appropriately in this case or they go bankrupt seems fair to me am i correct in assuming this is improper and if so what can be done to penalize such an improper use you could hold your breath you could kill offending messages as they come onto your machine and refuse to send them any further but not until you turn blue andy
