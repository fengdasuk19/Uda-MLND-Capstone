 from kxgst one pitt edu kenneth gilbert subject re contraceptive pill article i d blue seven nine eight four lines two zero x newsreader tin version one one pl eight jec watson ibm com wrote a very simple question it seems to me that the contraceptive pill just prevents the ovule to nest in the vagina and forces it to fall every month but it does not prevent the fertilzation of the ovule is it true if yes is there a risk of extra uterine pregnancy that is the development of the ovule inside the fallopian tube actually that is not how the pill works but it is how the iud works the oral contraceptive pill actually prevents ovulation from occuring by providing negatve feedback to the pituitary gland and thus preventing the lh surge that normally occurs at the time of ovulation with the iud what happens is that fertilization may occur but the device prevents implantation within the wall of the uterus not the vagina kenneth gilbert university of pittsburgh general internal medicine dammit not a programmer
