linked to serious asthma attacks american lung association a new study published by the american lung association has shown that surprisingly low concentrations of airborne particles can send people with asthma rushing to emergency rooms for treatment the seattle based study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution the actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed unsafe under federal air quality laws people with asthma have inflamed airways and airborne particles tend to exacerbate that inflammation said joel schwartz ph d of the environmental protection agency who was the lead author of the study when people are on the threshold of having a serious asthma attack particles can push them over the edge the seattle study correlated one three months of asthma emergency room visits with daily levels of pm or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of one zero microns or less these finer particles are considered hazardous because they are small enough penetrate into the lung cities are considered out of compliance with clean air laws if the two four hour average concentration of pm one zero exceeds one five zero micrograms per cubic millimeter of air in seattle however a link between fine particles and asthma was found at levels as low as three zero micrograms the authors concluded that for every three zero microgram increase in the four day average of pm one zero the odds of someone with asthma needing emergency treatment increased by one two percent the findings were published in the april american review of respiratory disease an official journal of the american thoracic society the lung association s medical section the study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat a one nine nine two study by dr schwartz and douglas dockery ph d of harvard found that particles may be causing roughly six zero zero zero zero premature deaths each year in the united states other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms and bronchitis in children government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone says dr schwartz but more and more research is showing that particles are bad actors as well one problem in setting standards for particulate air pollution is that pmio is difficult to study unlike other regulated pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide particulate matter is a complex and varying mixture of substances including carbon hydrocarbons dust and hicnet medical newsletter page two nine volume six number one zero april two zero one nine nine three acid aerosols researchers can t put people in exposure chambers to study the effects of particulate air pollution says dr schwartz we have no way of duplicating the typical urban mix of particles consequently most of what is known about particulates has been learned through population based research like the seattle study given that the epa s current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur dioxide standards the agency is unlikely to reexamine the pm one zero standard any time soon until changes are made there appears to be little people with asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles in some areas you can get reports on air quality but the reports only cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard and that s rarely particulate matter says dr schwartz however pm one zero doesn t have to be near its violation range to be unhealthy hicnet medical newsletter page three zero volume six number one zero april two zero one nine nine three nih consensus development conference on melanoma the national institutes of health consensus development conference on diagnosis and treatment of early melanoma brought together experts in dermatology pathology epidemiology public education surveillance techniques and potential new technologies as well as other health care professionals and the public to address one the clinical and histological characteristics of early melanoma two the appropriate diagnosis management and followup of patients with early melanoma three the role of dysplastic nevi and their significance and four the role of education and screening in preventing melanoma morbidity and mortality following two days of presentations by experts and discussion by the audience a consensus panel weighed the scientific evidence and prepared their consensus statement among their findings the panel recommended that one melanoma in situ is a distinct entity effectively treated surgically with zero five centimeter margins two thin invasive melanoma less than one millimeter thick has the potential for long term survival in more than nine zero percent of patients after surgical excision with a one centimeter margin three elective lymph node dissections and extensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma four patients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at high risk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely five some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk for melanoma and should be enrolled in surveillance programs and six education and screening programs have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality from melanoma a copy of the full text of the consensus panel s statement is available by calling the nih office of medical applications of research at

designated cancer centers actively engaged in multidisciplinary research efforts to reduce cancer incidence morbidity and mortality within the program there are four types of cancer centers basic science cancer centers one four which engage primarily in basic cancer research clinical cancer centers one two which focus on clinical research comprehensive cancer centers two eight which emphasize a multidisciplinary approach to cancer research patient care and community outreach and consortium cancer centers one which specialize in cancer prevention and control research although some cancer centers existed in the late one nine six zero s and the one nine seven zero s it was the national cancer act of one nine seven one that authorized the establishment of one five new cancer centers as well as continuing support for existing ones the passage of the act also dramatically transformed the centers structure and broadened the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic clinical and cancer control research over the next two decades the centers program grew progressively in one nine nine zero there were one nine comprehensive cancer centers in the nation today there are two eight of these institutions all of which meet specific nci criteria for comprehensive status to attain recognition from the nci as a comprehensive cancer center an institution must pass rigorous peer review under guidelines newly established in one nine nine zero the eight criteria for comprehensiveness include the requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in several scientific fields such as biology and molecular genetics a strong program of clinical research and an ability to transfer research findings into clinical practice moreover five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly beyond that required for attaining a cancer center support grant also referred to as a p three zero or core grant the mechanism of choice for supporting the infrastructure of a cancer center s operations these criteria encompass strong participation in nci designated high priority clinical trials significant levels of cancer prevention and control research and important outreach and educational activities all of which are funded by a variety of sources the other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit important new findings or address timely research questions hicnet medical newsletter page three two volume six number one zero april two zero one nine nine three of the five five nci designated cancer centers one four are of the basic science type these centers engage almost entirely in basic research although some centers engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications from new discoveries in the laboratory clinical cancer centers in contrast focus on both basic research and clinical research within the same institutional framework and frequently incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their overall research programs there are one two such centers today finally consortium cancer centers of which there is one are uniquely structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and control research these centers interface with state and local public health departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions responsible for implementing population wide public health programs consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials together the five five nci designated cancer centers continue to work toward creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research and through interdisciplinary efforts to effectively move this research from the laboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice comprehensive cancer centers internet addresses are given where available university of alabama at birmingham comprehensive cancer center basic health sciences building room one zero eight

multiple aids vaccines instead of only allowing the army to test a single vaccine administration sources said thursday the decision ends the controversy between army aids researchers who had hoped to test a vaccine made by microgenesys inc and the national institutes of health which contended that multiple vaccines should be tested health and human services secretary donna shalala said a final announcement on the therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last friday companies including genentech inc chiron corp and immuno ag have already told nih that they are prepared to participate in the vaccine tests the testing is intended to demonstrate whether aids vaccines are effective in thwarting the replication of hiv in patients already infected shalala refuted last week s reports that the clinton administration had decided the army s test of the microgenesys vaxsyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time the report was inaccurate and i expect there to be some announcement in the next two four hours about that particular aids research project said shalala administration sources subsequently confirmed that nih director dr bernadine healy and food and drug administration commissioner david kessler had convinced the white house that multiple vaccines should be tested simultaneously but microgenesys president frank volvovitz said a test of multiple vaccines could triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two years hicnet medical newsletter page four one volume six number one zero april two zero one nine nine three the limits of azt s impact

reported that although hiv positive patients taking azt demonstrated a slightly lower risk of developing aids within the first year of treatment that benefit disappeared two years later the lancet published preliminary findings of the three year study which could give more reason for critics to argue the drug s cost side effects and general efficacy even though u s researchers concede the study was more comprehensive than american trials many argue the european researchers suggestion that hiv positive patients experience little improvement in their illness before the development of aids
