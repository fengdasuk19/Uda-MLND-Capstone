a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard sun hp dec etc then you re going to have a hard time finding a vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard if your workstation runs the x window system you re in luck you can buy a cheap used pc hook your expensive keyboard up to it and run a serial cable to your workstation then run a program on the workstation to read the serial port and generate fake x keyboard events the two main programs i ve found to do this are kt and a two x a two x is a sophisticated program capable of controlling the mouse and even moving among widgets on the screen it requires a server extension xtest dec xtrap or xtestextension one to find out if your server can do this run xdpyinfo and see if any of these strings appear in the extensions list if your server doesn t have this you may want to investigate compiling x one one r five patchlevel one eight or later or bugging your vendor kt is a simpler program which should work with unextended x servers another program called xsendevent also exists but i haven t seen it both a two x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda berkeley edu two x terminals also a number of x terminals ncd tektronics to name a few use pc compatible keyboards if you have an x terminal you may be all set try it out with a normal pc keyboard before you go through the trouble of buying an alternative keyboard also some x
