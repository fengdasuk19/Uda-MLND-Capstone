 from jacquier gsbux one uchicago edu eric jacquier subject opinions on allergy hay fever shots organization university of chicago computing organizations lines one nine hello i am interested in trying this desensitization method against hay fever what is the state of affairs about this i went to a doctor and paid eight five for a one zero minute interview three scratches leading to the diagnostic that i am allergic to june and timothy grass i believe this from now on it looks like two shots per week for six months followed by one shot per month or so each shot costs two zero talking about soaring costs and the health care system i would call that a racket we are not talking about rare amazonian grasses here but the garbage which grows behind the doctor s office apart from this issue i was somewhat disappointed to find out that you have to keep getting the shots forever is that right thanks for information ej
