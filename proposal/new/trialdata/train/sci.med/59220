 from bmdelane quads uchicago edu brian manning delaney subject re diet for crohn s ibd reply to bmdelane midway uchicago edu organization university of chicago lines two seven one thing that i haven t seen in this thread is a discussion of the relation between ibd inflammation and the profile of ingested fatty acids fas i was diagnosed last may w crohn s of the terminal ileum when i got out of the hospital i read up on it a bit and came across several studies investigating the role of epa an essentially fa in reducing inflammation the evidence was mixed many of these studies are discussed in inflammatory bowel disease macdermott stenson one nine nine two but if i recall correctly there were some methodological bones to be picked with the studies both the ones w pos and w neg results in the studies patients were given epa a few grams day for most of the studies but if i recall correctly there was no restriction of the other fas that the patients could consume from the informed layperson s perspective this seems mistaken if lots of n six fas are consumed along with the epa then the ratio of bad prostanoid products to good prostanoid products could still be fairly bad isn t this ratio the issue what s the view of the gastro community on epa these days epa supplements along with a fairly severe restriction of other fas appear to have helped me significantly though it could just be the low absolute amount of fat i eat eight one zero calories brian
