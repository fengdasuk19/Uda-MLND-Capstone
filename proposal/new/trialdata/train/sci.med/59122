denver dept of health and hospitals surveillance and information systems br div of sexually transmitted diseases and hiv prevention national center for prevention svcs cdc editorial note the increase in reported gonorrhea cases in colorado in one nine nine two may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by cdh surveillance staff during one nine nine one one nine nine two the increases in confirmed gonorrhea cases at dmhc and in culture positivity rates in three of four laboratories suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact however the stable culture positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning laboratory which serves a network of clinics statewide indicates that the gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population one possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in colorado may be gang and drug related sexual behavior as implicated in a recent outbreak of drug resistant gonorrhea and other stds in colorado springs two although the high morbidity census tracts in the denver metropolitan area coincide with areas of gang and drug activity this hypothesis requires further assessment to examine the possible role of drug use implicated previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis

is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for gonorrhea and other stds risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at greatest risk for stds and for targeting prevention efforts moreover race specific variation in std rates may reflect differences in factors such as socioeconomic status access to medical care and high risk behaviors in response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea

the leading cause of death among children and young adults in the united states and account for more than one million years of potential life lost before age six five annually one child safety seats and safety belts can substantially reduce this loss two from one nine seven seven through one nine eight five all five zero states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety belts for children although these laws reduce injuries to young children by an estimated eight five nine three four motor vehicle crash related injuries remain a major cause of disability and death among u s children one while the use of occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age eight four usage for those aged zero four years five seven aged five one one years and two nine aged one two one eight years five in addition parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to use restraints for their children six to characterize the association between adult safety belt use and adult reported consistent use of occupant restraints for the youngest child aged less than one one years within a household cdc analyzed data obtained from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system brfss during one nine eight eight and one nine eight nine this report summarizes the findings from this study data were available for two zero nine zero five respondents aged greater than or equal to one eight years in one one states that participated in brfss a population based random digit dialed telephone survey and administered a standard injury control and child safety module developed by cdc of these respondents five four nine nine two six had a child aged less than one one years in their household each respondent was asked to specify the child s age and the frequency of restraint use for that child the two categories of child restraint and adult safety belt use in this analysis were one consistent use i e always buckle up and two less than consistent use i e almost always sometimes rarely or never buckle up data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state software for survey data analysis sudaan seven was used to calculate point

report subgrouped states into one those having a law requiring adult safety belt use law states and two those without such a law no law states overall two one of children aged less than one one years reportedly were not consistently restrained during automobile travel both child restraint use and adult restraint use were significantly higher p less than zero zero five chi square test in law states than in no law states eight one one versus seven four three and five eight seven versus four three two respectively high rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to one year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than consistent safety belt use figure one adults with consistent use reported high rates of child occupant restraint use regardless of the child s age range nine five five for one year olds to eight four seven for one zero year olds in comparison for adults reporting less than consistent safety belt use the rate of child occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child range nine three one for one year olds to two eight eight for one zero year olds when comparing children of consistent adult safety belt users with children of less than consistent adult safety belt users nine five confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age groups i e aged less than one and one year reported child occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded that in no law states regardless of age of child table one in addition higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with increased restraint use for children a factor that has also been associated with increased adult safety belt use eight reported by national center for injury prevention and control national center for chronic disease prevention and health promotion cdc editorial note the findings in this report are consistent with others indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to employ occupant restraints for their children six nine because these nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit other risk taking behaviors children traveling with them may be at greater risk for motor vehicle injury one zero educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with child restraint use in this report accordingly occupant protection programs should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment because low educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status such programs should be offered to adults through health care facilities that serve low income communities or through federal programs i e head start that are directed at parents with young children injury prevention programs emphasize restraining young children in addition however efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as hicnet medical newsletter page one eight volume six number one zero april two zero one nine nine three they become older parents especially those with low educational attainment those who do not consistently wear safety belts and those from states that do not have mandatory safety belt use laws should be encouraged to wear safety belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and safety belts finally the increased use of restraints among children may increase their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers the age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety belt use and the highest rate of fatal crashes five references one cdc childhood injuries in

this report covers birth defects surveillance in metropolitan atlanta georgia and selected jurisdictions in california for the years one nine eight three one nine eight eight description of system the california birth defects monitoring program and the metropolitan atlanta congenital defects program are two population based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods the prevalence estimates for four four diagnostic categories were based on data for one nine eight three one nine eight eight for six three nine eight three seven births in california and one five two nine seven zero births in metropolitan atlanta the prevalences in the two areas were compared adjusting for race sex and maternal age by using poisson regression results regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis fetal alcohol syndrome hip dislocation dysplasia microcephalus obstruction of the kidney ureter and scoliosis lordosis may be attributable to general diagnostic variability however differences in the prevalences of arm hand limb reduction encephalocele spina bifida or trisomy two one down syndrome are probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment because these defects are relatively easy to diagnose interpretation regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination may affect prevalences of trisomy two one and spina bifida however the reason for differences in arm hand reduction is unknown but may be related to variability in environmental exposure heterogeneity in the gene pool or random variation actions taken because of the similarities of these data bases several collaborative studies are being implemented in particular the differences in the birth prevalence of spina bifida and down syndrome will focus attention on the impact of prenatal diagnosis authors jane schulman ph d nancy hicnet medical newsletter page two one volume six number one zero april two zero one nine nine three jensvold m p h gary m shaw dr

on morbidity and mortality annually from october through may reporting period covered this report covers u s influenza surveillance conducted from october one nine eight eight through may one nine eight nine description of system weekly reports from the vital statistics offices of one two one cities provided an index of influenza s impact on mortality five eight who collaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza viruses weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and territorial epidemiologists and from one five three sentinel family practice physicians nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received throughout the year results during the one nine eight eight eight nine influenza season influenza a h one n one and b viruses were identified in the united states with essentially equal frequency overall although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted over the course of the season throughout the season increases in the indices of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza a h one n one predominated were similar to increases in regions where influenza b predominated only seven of identified viruses were influenza a h three n two but isolations of this subtype increased as the season waned and it subsequently predominated during the one nine eight nine nine zero season during the one nine eight eight eight nine season outbreaks in nursing homes were reported in association with influenza b and a h three n two but not influenza a h one n one interpretation the alternating temporal and geographic predominance of influenza strains a h one n one and b during the one nine eight eight eight nine season emphasizes the importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance since amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza a actions taken weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced throughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make informed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine cdc s annual surveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates for

office of public affairs at the university of arizona health sciences center copyright one nine nine three the university of arizona high tech assisted reproductive technologies following the birth of the first in vitro fertilization embryo transfer ivf et baby in one nine seven eight a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been developed that include ivf et gamete intrafallopian tube transfer gift embryo cryopreservation freezing and gamete micromanipulation together these technologies are referred to as the high tech assisted reproductive technology art procedures ovulation induction sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and or pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility management however when these fail it almost always is appropriate to proceed with one of the art procedures therefore in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility service at the university of arizona center for reproductive endocrinology and infertility there is a program of assisted reproduction that specializes in art procedures this program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients in the state of arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the traditional therapies the following article on back describes the art procedures available in our center clarifies appropriate applications for each and considers the realistic expectations for their success procedures included are o in vitro o fertilization embryo transfer ivf et gamete intrafallopian tube transfer o gift cryopreservation of human embryos and gamete micromanipulation this article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed towards improved success of these technologies hicnet medical newsletter page two four volume six number one zero april two zero one nine nine three future areas of research in addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the management of infertile couples we are developing the technology to assist couples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary disease this technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either dna amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization there are recent reports of the successful application of dna amplification by other centers for example for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and hemophilia we hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ hybridization technology for probing the x chromosome the identification of which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit sex linked disorders the considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis in addition to the possibility of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses in order to avoid the birth of affected children catherine racowsky ph d associate professor and director of research department of obstetrics and gynecology college of medicine university of arizona tucson arizona applications success rates and advances for the management of infertility the following are the art procedures available at the university of arizona center for reproductive endocrinology and infertility in vitro fertilization embryo transfer is the core art procedure of our assisted reproduction program this procedure involves retrieval of unfertilized eggs from the ovary their insemination in vitro in a dish and the culture of resultant embryos for one or two days before they are transferred to the patient s uterus all cultures are maintained in an incubator under strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions before being processed for use in insemination semen samples are evaluated in our andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer hicnet medical newsletter page two five volume six number one zero april two zero one nine nine three assisted semen analyses to ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to perform ivf et or indeed gift follicular development is typically stimulated with gonadotropins perganol metrodin gonadotropin releasing hormone gnrh factrel lutrepulse and or gnrh analogues lupron depo lupron synarel occasionally however ivf et is accomplished with eggs obtained in non stimulated cycles while some programs utilize laparoscopic egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound guided retrieval in our infertility unit with the patient sedated couples who resort to ivf et exhibit such pathologies as tubal deficiencies ovulatory dysfunction endometriosis and or mild forms of male factor infertility according to the united states ivf registry the overall success rate for ivf et nationwide has stabilized at about one four percent per cycle results from our program involving eight six patients who have undergone one seven three ivf et cycles reflect a comparable success rate nevertheless the overall incidence of success with this procedure is disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies well recognized predictors of outcome include patient age response to exogenous ovarian stimulation quality of sperm and number of repeated ivf et cycle attempts however among these age is the single most significant determinant of conception therefore it is critical that such patients are referred to an assisted reproduction program at the earliest opportunity following failure of traditional therapies the underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not been clearly delineated beyond recognition that one the number of eggs available for retrieval declines markedly with age two fertilization rates significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over four zero years and three provided the appropriate hormonal background is present age is unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy ongoing research in our center therefore is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may be impacted by age we have determined that more than five zero percent of eggs that fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal and that a significant proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age currently the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor our program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy gift this high tech art procedure is performed in the operating room usually with the use of a laparoscope and in contrast to ivf et involves introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the fallopian tube an average of three eggs tube under these circumstances fertilization occurs in vivo and if excess eggs are retrieved the remainder undergo ivf with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle or freezing for transfer in a subsequent cycle this art procedure is applied to cases in hicnet medical newsletter page two six volume six number one zero april two zero one nine nine three which there is at least one patent fallopian tube but the couple has such pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction endometriosis male factor infertility and or idiopathic infertility the data reported in the united states ivf registry for one nine eight five through one nine nine zero indicate that the overall success rate with gift is higher than that obtained with the ivf et technique range of clinical pregnancies for gift is two four to three six percent and for ivf et one four to one eight percent in view of this fact one might expect more patients to be treated with gift than ivf et however in our program we have taken into account three basic concerns which while substantially reducing the number of gift cycles performed benefit the patient these concerns are one the increased costs associated with performing a procedure in the operating room two the risks albeit minimal of undergoing general anesthesia and three the considerable benefits to be accrued from obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs and the developmental competency of resultant embryos the increased success with gift undoubtedly reflects the artificial environment provided by the laboratory in the ivf et procedure between january one one nine nine one and december three one one nine nine two we have performed a total of one two gift cycles with an overall success rate of two zero percent embryo cryopreservation or freezing is applied in our program when embryos result from residual gift eggs or from non transferred ivf embryos this procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for success at much reduced costs but also circumvents the legal and ethical issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos therefore as stipulated by the american fertility society ethical guidelines for art programs from both a practical and an ethical standpoint all assisted reproduction programs should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys gamete micromanipulation this art procedure which is still very new is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but who have severe male factor infertility less than one zero million sperm ml in combination with fewer than two zero perccent motile sperm and or less than one zero percent sperm with normal morphology we are currently developing the procedure of sub zonal insertion szi which entails injecting sperm under the coating around the egg the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm through enzymatic digestion available data from szi programs world wide indicate that only five to one zero percent of szi cycles result in a pregnancy this statistic undoubtedly relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm therefore we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation such efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to establish conception catherine racowsky ph d hicnet medical newsletter page two seven volume six number one zero april two zero one nine
