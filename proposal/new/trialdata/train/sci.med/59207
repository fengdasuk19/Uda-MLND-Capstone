 from banschbach vms ocom okstate edu subject how to prevent kidney stone formation lines one five four nntp posting host vms ocom okstate edu organization osu college of osteopathic medicine i got asked in sci med nutrition about vitamin c and oxalate production toxic kidney stone formation i decided to post my answer here as well because of the recent question about kidney stones not long after i got into sci med i got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation i m going to state it again here but the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take b six supplements read on to find out why i have my asbestos suit on now guys vitamin c will form oxalic acid but large doses are needed above six grams per day one review article nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney stones with particular emphasis on vitamin c int clin nutr rev five three one one zero one two nine one nine eight five but glycine also forms oxalic acid d amino acid oxidases for both glycine and vitamin c one of the best ways to drastically reduce this production is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin c or glycine but to increase your intake of vitamin b six two control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in patients with kidney stones int urol nephrol two zero four three five three five nine one nine eight eight two zero zero to five zero zero mg of b six each day significasntly decreased the urinary excretion of oxalate over the one eight month treatment program three the action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria clin sci three eight two seven seven eight six one nine seven zero patients receiving at least one five zero mg b six each day showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels for gylcine this effect is due to increased transaminase activity b six is required for transaminase activity which makes less glycine available for oxidative deamination d amino acid oxidases for vitamin c the effect is quite different there are different pathways for vitamin c catabolism the pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have one seven to four zero of the ingested dose going into oxalic acid but this is highly variable and the vitamin c review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto six grams per day not too much vitamin c gets catabolized to form oxalic acid at very high doses of vitamin c above one zero grams per day more of the extra vitamin c more than four zero conversion can end up as oxalic acid in a very early study on vitamin c and oxalic production proc soc exp biol med eight five one nine zero nine two one nine five four intakes of two grams per day up to nine grams per day increased the average oxalic acid excretion from three eight mg per day up to one seven eight mg per day until eight grams per day was reached the average excreted was increased by only three to one two mg per day two gram dose four gram dose eight gram dose and nine gram dose eight grams jumped it to four five mg over the average excretion before supplementation and nine grams jumped it to one five zero mg over the average before supplementation b six is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body there are probably some enzymes that require vitamin b six that we don t know about yet vitamin c catabolism is still not completely understood but the speculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must have an enzyme in it that requires b six differences in b six levels could then explain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin c challenge this is not the preferred route of catabolism increasing your intake of b six would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you take vitamin c supplements since the typical american diet is deficient in b six some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium oxalate kidney stones is b six deficiency especially since so little oxalic acid gets absorbed from the gut diets providing zero to one three zero mg of oxalic acid per day showed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate urol int three five three zero nine one five one nine eight zero if four zero zero mg was present each day there was a significant increase in urinary oxalate excretion here are the high oxalate foods one beans coca instant coffee parsley rhubarb spinach and tea contain at least two five mg one zero zero grams two beet tops carrots celery chocolate cumber grapefruit kale peanuts pepper sweet potatoe contain one zero to two five mg one zero zero grams if the threshold is one three zero mg per day you can see that you really have a lot of latitude in food selection a recent n eng j med article also points out that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your intake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being absorbed at all if you also increase your intake of b six you shouldn t have to worry about kidney stones at all the rda for b six is two mg per day for males and one six mg per day for females directly related to protein intake b six can be toxic nerve damage if it is consumed in doses of five zero zero mg or more per day for an extended peroid weeks to months the usda food survey done in one nine eight six had an average intake of one eight seven mg per day for males and one one six mg per day for females living in the u s coupled with this low intake was a high protein diet which greatly increases the b six requirement as well as the presence of some of the four zero different drugs that either block b six absorption are metabolic antagonists of b six or promote b six excretion in the urine common ones are birth control pills alcohol isoniazid penicillamine and corticosteroids i tell my students to supplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that increase the b six requirement the dose recommended for patients taking birth control pills is one zero one five mg per day and this should work for most of the other drugs that increase the b six requirement this would be on top of your dietary intake of b six any patient that has a history of kidney stone formation should be given b six supplements one other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your ca mg dietary ratio is two

there are actually about three times as many articles published in the medical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone formation than there are for b six i thought that i was being pretty safe in stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier post in this news group but good old john a in mass jumped all over me i guess that he doesn t read the medical literature oh well since kidney stones can be a real pain and a lot of people suffer from them i thought i d tell you how you can avoid the pain and stay out of the doctor s office martin
