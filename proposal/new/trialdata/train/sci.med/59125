once an image is scanned you can bring up the pop up image verification the software gives you two errors at this point blue which are words that were converted reliability but do not match anything in the built in dictionary yellow shade which are words that wordscan plus doesn t think it converted correctly at all i have found that the software should give itself more credit it is usually correct instead of wrong if a word is shaded blue you can add it to your personal dictionary the only problem is the personal dictionary will only handle about two zero zero words i find this to be very limited considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary after a document is converted you can save it in a multitude of word processor formats also any images that were captured

soon be eliminated as a public health problem one infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in the united states since the early one nine seven zero s the u s public health system has been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes e g escherichia coli o one five seven h seven hepatitis c virus human immunodeficiency virus legionnaires disease lyme disease and toxic shock syndrome the incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control such as cholera malaria and tuberculosis tb have increased in many areas furthermore control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea malaria pneumococcal disease salmonellosis shigellosis tb and staphylococcal infections two emerging infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons those in institutional settings e g hospitals and child day care centers and minority and underserved populations the substantial economic burden of emerging infections on the u s health care system could be reduced by more effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs three this issue of mmwr introduces a new series emerging infectious diseases future articles will address these diseases as well as surveillance control and prevention efforts by health care providers and public health officials this first article updates the ongoing investigation of an outbreak of e coli o one five seven h seven in the western united

enteric diseases br div of bacterial and mycotic diseases national center for infectious diseases cdc editorial note e coli o one five seven h seven is a pathogenic gram negative bacterium first identified as a cause of illness in one nine eight two during an outbreak of severe bloody diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers two this pathogen has since emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and hus the most common cause of acute renal failure in children outbreak investigations have linked most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef although other food vehicles including roast beef raw milk and apple cider also have been implicated three preliminary data from a cdc two year nationwide multicenter study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for e coli o one five seven h seven that organism was isolated more frequently than shigella in four of one zero participating hospitals and was isolated from seven eight of all bloody stools a higher rate than for any other pathogen infection with e coli o one five seven h seven often is not recognized because most clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on hicnet medical newsletter page seven volume six number one zero april two zero one nine nine three smac medium and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses associated with infection four the usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea often bloody and abdominal cramps fever is infrequent younger age groups and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and complications illness usually resolves after six eight days but two seven of patients develop hus which is characterized by hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenia renal failure and a death rate of three five this report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community outbreaks of e coli o one five seven h seven in the absence of routine surveillance despite the magnitude of this outbreak the problem may not have been recognized in three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in washington one clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from persons with bloody diarrhea or hus for e coli o one five seven h seven using smac agar five when infections with e coli o one five seven h seven are identified they should be reported to local health departments for further evaluation and if necessary public health action to prevent further cases e coli o one five seven h seven lives in the intestines of healthy cattle and can contaminate meat during slaughter cdc is collaborating with the u s department of agriculture s food safety inspection service to identify critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce the likelihood of pathogens such as e coli o one five seven h seven entering the meat supply because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with pathogens and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens from the surface of the meat to the interior ground beef is likely to be internally contaminated the optimal food protection practice is to cook ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink and the juices are clear in this outbreak undercooking of hamburger patties likely played an important role the food and drug administration fda has issued interim recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to one five five f eight six one c fda personal communication one nine nine three regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of outbreaks the public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections caused by e coli o one five seven h seven and for hus to better define the epidemiology of e coli o one five seven h seven references one cdc preliminary report foodborne outbreak of escherichia coli o one five seven h seven infections from

national center for chronic disease prevention and health promotion div of health interview statistics national center for health statistics cdc editorial note the findings in this report indicate that the use of smokeless tobacco was highest among young males adolescent and young adult males in particular are the target of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that link smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility use of oral snuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players encouraging this behavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for nicotine addiction oral cancer and other mouth disorders four differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among racial ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels and socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require further explanation for example targeted marketing practices may play a role in maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups and affecting the differential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons five six in this report one concern is that nearly one fourth of current smokeless
