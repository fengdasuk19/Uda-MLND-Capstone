 from bcash crchh four one zero nosubdomain nodomain brian cash subject re ancient islamic rituals nntp posting host crchh four one zero organization bnr inc lines three eight in article darice yoyo cc monash edu au fred rice writes there has been some discussion on the pros and cons about sex outside of marriage where is the evidence for my opinions at the moment there are just generalities i can cite for example i read that in the two zero th century the percentage of youth and people in general who suffer from depression has been steadily climbing in western societies probably what i was reading referred particularly to the usa similarly one can detect a trend towards greater occurrence of sex outside of marriage in this century in western societies particularly with the sexual revolution of the six zero s but even before that i think otherwise the sexual revolution of the six zero s would not have been possible particularly with the gradual weakening of christianity and consequently christian moral teachings against sex outside of marriage i propose that these two trends greater level of general depression in society and other psychological problems and greater sexual promiscuity are linked with the latter being a prime cause of the former i cannot provide any evidence beyond this at this stage but the whole thesis seems very reasonable to me and i request that people ponder upon it fred rice darice yoyo cc monash edu au i think this is a big leap sex depression one example is myself where no sex depression but seriously one promiscuity is on a decline depression is not and two it might be more reasonable to say depression promiscuity i think depression is more likely to come from emotional problems relationships family job friends and promiscuity is used as an escape since i see marriage as a civil and religious bond rather than an emotional bond i don t see a problem with sex before not outside of marriage so long as you have the same commitment and devotion as what is expected from a married couple of course this is just my opinion brian
